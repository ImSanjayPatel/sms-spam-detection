It feels like a shock, it’s crazy how quickly it took over my shopping routine! I’ve officially been brainwashed by Apple because now it feels so inconvenient to even carry a physical card in my pocket.\n",

      "Guys, a quick note that you do NOT need all the high-end tech in order to do well at college. If you can (and you should), save as much money as you can while at college, pay your tuition in full and student loans as soon as possible instead of spending on liabilities like gadgets. Get the bare minimum you need and only spend money on products you know you are going to be using for 4-6 years (such as laptop). Don't overspend on phone, headphones, lamps, tablets, etc.\n",
      "this is hilarious. i was in a focus group over 4 years ago for Best Buy where they were asking college students how to advertise for Back to School. One of the kids next to me said \"Maybe you should have someone like MKBHD talk about your products\". Well... here we are\n",
      "Everyone has been saying it but I’ll throw my hat in as well. To any prospective college students, you DO NOT need to spend money on flagship products. I am about to graduate with a business degree and have been using a 7 year old laptop and the base iPad from late 2020. Both products have worked flawlessly and I have no intention of replacing them. The recommendations listed are ones I would never be able to afford even with my job I’m working as well. Do your own research on forums to see what your peers say the best value product is. I promise that if you buy a flagship product you will quickly see that you did not need it.\n",

      "Personally I feel like this is really out of touch. Most students won't be able to afford these. In case anyone needs it: I believe Dave2D's back to school video are honestly the best ones I've seen on the topic. Consider checking them out too before making a purchase decision.\n",

I choose tab s7 over Apple Ipad Air for its ease of use, user interface, and cost (you get stylus for free with Tab S7 and in most cases keyboard too with a huge student discount).\n",

      "Back in 2018 when John Oliver did the episode on Corporate Consolidation it inspired me so much that I applied for a Masters of Research program, got into a program, and did my entire research thesis on tech oligopolies. It was shocking to see how bad it really is; oligopolies that bordered in monopolies are rampant. My research essentially focused on the question of whether lack of enforcement of our antitrust laws caused this whole problem or whether lack of adequate laws were the core of the issue. The answer was that it was truly both. I thoroughly enjoyed my pre-doctoral masters thesis and am considering a PhD in the future. It's so lovely to see John talk about this, specifically on the tech sector!\n",

      "Hey, something that might interest you. A couple of days ago my Amazon account was closed with no warning for after hours of wasted time they're telling me it's for excessive returns which I think is an error but that's beside the point. When they closed my Amazon account all my Amazon devices that I own for years primarily all my Echo devices stopped working. I lost access to the Amazon Photos and Prime Video which I pay for. So apparently the devices you already own are subject to be disabled by Amazon on your perceived shopping habits! I assume the same applies to all other Amazon devices and services like fire OS tablets, Ring cameras, and probably AWS as well.

      "The thing is, if you give someone all of these perks and a flexible schedule, you need to also give them the freedom to use that flexibility. You must make it clear that the company expects you to take down time, and you will not be frowned upon either officially or unofficially.

Which ultimately look alike same goes for the Australian / american market. I am kinda stoked to see though what sort of dashcams are actually used within South Korea, Japan if anybody could give a hint to that! I mean surely they must have great dashcams right? Japan being the leading technology country in the 80s and having a severe amount of car enthusiasts, and well South Korea being well the main birth place of any technology centre and fab well at least a good portion in my mind.\n",

      "I bought this one due to a recommendation from a friend of mine. Problem I have with it is quality related the G-Sensor broke not long after I bought the thing and started using it kinda unfortunate. This creates an issue of the thing constantly making emergency recordings. And in that mode you can't disable the screen from flashing so at night drives you'll really get beamed in your faze and think someone put a flashlight up to your head nope. It's your f#+*^# dashcam You can improve further the video quality for e.g. when experincing intense sun glare which is usually caused on these by using a ND-Filter you just have to find your own way to mount them. Usually there is full filter clamping solutions. Because you'll have to overshoot with the filter anyhow.\n",

      "#AskGCNTech after two years of running tubes, I finally went tubeless a couple of months ago. I managed to puncture my tyre the other day. Sealant didn’t do the trick nor did a couple of slugs - even tried a patch inside the tyre. The puncture was not on the sidewall and may have been 3mm large. Given the tire had plenty of life left, I am gutted that I may have to discard the tire now. When would you come to a decision that a tubeless tire is KO?\n",

I know these sound insignificant, but since you rarely update your little dongles/accessories that you carry around and your apps on your home screens, I think it would be interesting to get a little maybe quarterly series where you talk about any changes and what you'd like to see changed/simplified with those work flows.

Wanted to give you a little tip I found on that bag, here goes: The main compartment has a pass through to the top zip area where phones, airpods, etc go.  You just have to fish a cable through the corner.  I do this by unzipping the side compartment enough to fish through the cable.  It makes it so I can leave a pass through USB travel battery charger with folding prongs, that means I plug in all my devices when they're in the zip area (laptop, phone, tablet and airpods) and they all get charge from the battery AND when I get to the hotel late, I just plug one one cable into the wall outlet and I hear all my devices chime in unison that they are now charging neatly in place.  Not only that when they're done charging the battery starts charging.  I wake up with everything ready to go.  Hope you enjoy trying this out. :)\n",

While part of the reason was the battery being too thin, the main issue was a manufacturing defect in the corner of most of the batteries at launch, which was a tiny dent in the top (left?) corner. This would cause the battery to eventually short out, as the dent caused both terminals to eventually touch each other.

Now the front line has clearly been drawn between civilization and savagery.

      "Netflix in a lot of trouble now especially as more market competition comes in from other distributors. This move into gaming will not do them any favours.\n",
      "The reason Netflix is struggling is because they keep losing content, their own content, when it's good, is constantly neglected, and they keep raising the price without adding commensurate value to justify it. Getting into games demonstrates that they are not recognizing what they're doing wrong and simply trying to find a new source of revenue instead of fixing their faults. People are getting sick of having the price increased while more and more good content disappears or takes far too long to update. People are used to getting the next season of a series once every year, but many of them are taking 2 to 3 years to release, even before COVID.\n",

      "I adopted a mindset of delaying my gaming brain by a year. If a game comes out in 2022, I wait until 2023. I get it at its cheapest and usually complete. I have been doing this with every game I buy for the last 5 years and I have saved so much money while enjoying the games much more.\n",
      "I used to pre-order games to get the “collectible” toy that was sought after. The items got really cheap really fast. Not worth it. They also tell you that there may not be enough copies, that never happened! There was always enough copies!\n",
      "Good video. These are the kinds of topics and discussions the gaming industry needs to need to be having now. Publishers, developers, the media, and gamers themselves. \n",
      "\n",
      "Have to throw one in though. For every game with a yearly release, I also have to point out games with decade or more release cycle. How long between GTA 5 and 6? Fallout 4 and 5? Skyrim and Elder Scrolls 6?\n",
      "I wish developers would realize that forced DRM and Internet connectivity for games is a step backward. Look at the debacles GT7 and SimCity have endured; what's the point of paying a full $70 for the game if there is no guarantee you can play it at your leisure, especially if this ridiculous requirement is in place for SINGLE-PLAYER modes?\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion, at that point, you can't help but wonder if spending time with the game is either fun or just another full time job. This is not why people play games.\n",
      "When I think about the games I played the last few years, I must say, that I almost always enjoyed indie titles alot more than big IPs. So I rather pay 30€ for an indie title, that is really inspiring with fresh new ideas than wasting 60€+ on a broken AAA title without any innovations.\n",
      "Great vid, points are spot on, only 4 or 5 years ago, feels like I bought every major release at midnight, and after Cyberpunk, Fallout, No Mans Sky, I’m never buying a day one game again.  My gaming and spending habits have completely changed.  The gaming biz can’t devolve and expect players to keep up the old pace.\n",
      "I havent bought a game on release for the past 6 years now. The gaming industry has changed for a while now, and its only getting worse. I buy 3~4 games per year at most and usually heavily discounted. Quality multiplayer games are a rarity nowadays, CoD and Battlefield lost their way. Quality single player games are still a thing but are often filled with bugs on release so i wait it out and buy GoTY editions usually and often second hand (gotta love disc edition systems). I refuse to fuel bad descions made by money hungry devs or publishers.\n",
      "I tend to stick to games made before 2010 as they give the best value and experience.\n",
      "Feels like games were made for fun rather then rip off the player.\n",
      "This video made me a bit sad. Made me realise how the industry has changed, and not for the better. I have young children so can’t game like I used to but when I do have time I find myself increasingly drawn back to older games that I’ve played before but adore, the vast majority of new games just don’t appeal to me. As for the new gen consoles…what’s the point, all they seem to be doing is rereleasing older gen games. Yawn\n",

      "I've been around for every console generation.  I remember thinking during the Genesis/Turbografx era (SNES not out quite yet) what games would be like when I was old, and the kind of specs they would need.  Obviously I had no idea what the specs really meant back then, but I was thinking \"256-bit\" lol.  (as for the CPU, and 64-bit is all we really need for that)  They have happily progressed faster than I had imagined, looking just as good today, if not better, then I imagined things would look like 20~25 years from now.  The 1990's and early 2000's with the massive clock speed increases and the advent of the GPU were the main things that took us to where we are, hardware wise.\n",
      "We are an architecture and construction company in Chile, and we have used Unreal Engine for a long time and it is the best for real-time visualization 😁 The preview versions of Unreal 5 were already spectacular and the best thing is the lighting - Lumion really changed everything.\n",

      "Great video! I think I'll still be leaning toward the C2 though as the £400 price difference at the moment is too appealing.\n",
      "Awesome review! What are your thoughts on the picture quality compared to the LG C2 42? Does the matte coating make a noticeable difference to the picture quality? I want to get a new monitor for work and gaming but not sure if i should get the C2 at a cheaper price, this, or perhaps wait another year for something new?\n",

      "My dream spec for a gaming monitor would be pretty close to this:  42 inches or so, anti-glare, normal aspect ratio not ultra wide, but 1440 @ 200mhz instead of 4k (because not even a 3090ti will do anywhere near 4k @ 138mhz in most decent looking aaa titles anyway).\n",
      "\n",
      "If possible, i had a couple of suggestions for things to look at over the course of your full review:\n",
      "\n",
      "- What do resolutions other than 4k look like on the monitor (try playing a game in 1080/1440 and seeing what the monitor's scaling is like)\n",
      "- In the settings, what HDR options are available?\n",

      "theory: the reason why you saw a second karl might have something to do with abandoned cars like Cristine. Karl is the first abandoned car and over time it withered and due to the desert heat its paint melted all over it making it all covered in blue paint and eventually a bunny accidently glitched in there and died and they're soul got sucked in creating the first karl which then killed the player and over time the karl became more and more smart and even attained sentience and started converting other cars into karls and karrot and karla were his first ones which had a few problems which is why they are diffrent eventually karl found out about you and how many times you abandoned cristine and the last time you did he converted all of the old ones (he kept on finding new ones not going back and getting them back) and are now mad at you and your stupid sedan. it also explains why he keeps coming back\n",

      "Gotta love Lenovo. Got the Ryzen 5600H version of this laptop with the same 3050 after seeing the positive reviews you guys gave it and I couldn't have been happier. It was 700€ in Italy at the time. Paired with my Wacom Cintiq and a RAM upgrade it's been the perfect little gaming and Digital painting set up.\n",
      "People have been going crazy for the gigabyte G5 KD going for a relativelyaffordable price for an i5 11400H and RTX 3060, would be cool to see you guys buy and review it to see how good it is\n",
      "Lenovo always been crazy in the budget gaming laptop market. My first introduction to \"PC gaming\" was a 1080p lenovo with SLI 750m's. Was a killer deal too. Back when the 7 series was Nvidia's newest line. I remember looking up so many videos about its performance in games weeks before I got it. I haven't gotten anything Lenovo since as I build my own towers now and get much more premium laptops, but I will always appreciate and respect what Lenovo does.\n",
      "I managed to snag a MSI GF63 thin 10UC with a i5-10500h, RTX 3050, 16gb RAM, 144Hz display, and 512gb NVME storage for 570 euros.\n",
      "Nice. Definitely a great value.  I still have my old Lenovo 960M 4GB gaming laptop. I never upgraded it from 8gb of ram and that would've been an easy move for more performance. Now it doesn't make sense as I upgraded to an Alienware with a 3080 and 32gb of ram but I still sometimes fire up the Lenovo to see what it can do in 2022.\n",
      "I just bought this today on best buy for 570 dollars! Love to see your making a video on it\n",
      "Recently bought a Lenovo legion laptop for 539 on eBay. 4600h 1650 ti 8gb rams and 512ssd. Never been happier. Lenovo makes the best bang for the buck laptops. Also they aren’t to flashy.\n",
      "I got an older version of the Ideapad Gaming 3, with a 1650 but with a Ryzen 5600h, and a 512gb ssd. It's an amazing laptop, but I bough it at the time last year for $750, not a bargain but a well balanced laptop for work and gaming\n",
      "I have the model from 2019. Mine has an i7-9850H and a mobile GTX 1650. This is a great machine aside from some plastic chipping due to the lid being opened and closed.\n",
      "It annoyingly was $1,300 with discounts.\n",
      "This laptop has the 4-core/8-thread i5 11300H, not the 6-core/12-thread 11400H - big difference, and you need to update your video description accordingly.

      "Just stumbled upon your channel after successfully ordering a PS5 yesterday through Sony Direct. The anticipation of it getting delivered made me want to watch some unboxings and reviews. I came across your channel and immediately clicked because we have the same last name which is neat haha. I actually really enjoyed your video. It’s informative, offers great insight, and very professional while maintaining a personal creative nuance. Thank you!\n",
      "I got the controller alone for use on my pc and I'm shocked that it works so natively well, of course none game that I know of uses the trigger gimmick... but the sound/vibration feedback works like a charm! sure it does require some set up but it works!\n",
      "I honestly think Marques should start a gaming channel, only so we can appreciate him \"enjoying\" his tech in the way most people will do. Being very analytical and knowledgeable about tech is a great benefit to those who come to this channel, but there is a slight otherworldliness to seeing some talk about tech in a matter of fact way and not seeing them actually use it in a real world environment and showing that they actually enjoy the thing they are criticising...which to be fair no one with sense would think he doesn't enjoy his tech but seeing it would be a great addition.\n",

      "The part where they're talking about the initial rollout of the SNES in North America hits home. They mention something about how expensive it was for the time, and how the state of the US economy in 1991 meant it was probably the only \"toy\" the average American parent could buy their kids that year. Took up the entire toy budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "That happened to my family. Christmas 1991 and all my brothers and sisters are there, 4 of us ranging from 10 to 18 years old. My parents had a single present for the 4 of us, the Super Nintendo with Super Mario World.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was one of the best gifts of all our lives, because we had all wanted the SNES badly. We literally played it all that Christmas Eve night and into Christmas day. It's a great family memory that we all still hold with us, now all in our 40's and 50's with families of our own.\n",

      "I’m in my earlier 40s. I’ve found it difficult to go back and still enjoy many of the games from my youth, but Super Mario World still holds up. I think it will continue to stand the test of time with the ageless gameplay and level design. It’s a masterpiece.\n",
      "A fantastic and well made documentary that truly made me feel like a kid again. I could feel my 5 year old self anticipating this 16 bit treasure as you were describing the build up to Mario world's launch in America. I haven't truly felt that way in a long time. Thank you.\n",

      "Polamalu jumping over the line against the Titans is extra smart, because he knows that even if he's too early, it's a flag, but just half the distance to the goal. They're already so close to the goal line that it doesn't matter.\n",
      "In case you’re wondering why the clock didn’t stop at that obj play, the rule states that if you aren’t gaining yards while going out of bounds, the clock keeps running. This is a great example of OBJ- he can’t just catch, but he can run, throw, kick, you name it.\n",
      "Wow what an incredibly well researched video, so many great moments and some I haven't even seen before! Only wish you would've included when Alex Smith hid the ball from the refs, but great video nonetheless!\n",

It's not like someone tripped you up before getting a touchdown. The game is literally over, all you do is hold onto the ball for a couple seconds and that's it. The Washington Wizards were up by 3 at that point. Even if the apposing team has time to foul you, you hit just 1 free throw and it's over. Even if you miss both, they have to somehow rebound the ball and go for a full court shot to TIE the game in an impossible amount of time... Long story short, that throw lost them the game after OT lol... Just look at his fellow teammates staring at him in total disbelief afterwards. Gotta be one of the worst throws in sports history.\n",

I hope they can be patient, grab the opportunities, and show what they are capable of on the pitch as the season keep going on. Compared to the last season, this is a huge improvement. The squad depth is so much thicker that we are using Tomiyasu, Smith Rowe, and Tierney as substitutes.

In her career she also made a couple of records the same day, but the first was particular.\n",

As a long time LFC supporter I can't help but compare the decision to let Sadio Mane go to the same situation with Xavi Alonso some years back. I think that J. Klopp is going to have to put in some serious time working with this squad to get anywhere close to a top 4 position this year. Hope I am wrong but, if I am being honest Man.

      "Haaland should’ve gotten the ball a couple times. However, he opened up so much space just by being on the pitch. He is a threat and the teams know it\n",
      "Kevin De Bruyne, world class as usual. Haaland should've at least gotten on the scoresheet if Foden squared him in, but at least he got an assist. He can still find a way to contribute without goals.\n",
      "Seems like Man City still haven’t fully adapted to Haaland, at least 2 more goals would’ve been scored If they had given him the ball in the right areas.\n",
      "That first half was a master-class by KDB and that goal, using the outside of his foot, was terrific.\n",

So he's eccentric...let him be eccentric...as long as no one gets hurt including himself.  Just let him lose and let the team win.\n",

      "Commentators: wow… nice.\n",
      "3:36 Never gets old. The very definition of situational awareness\n",
      "1:56 wow, the accuracy to make that ball come back to him exactly where he needed off the rim is impressive. Tiny bit too low or high and it wouldn’t have worked\n",
      "That forward flip where he partially vaults off the other player is amazing. Even if you could practice for a thing like that it'd still be hard to pull off.\n",
      "Doesn’t matter who we buy at this point. Once they’re here they’ll regress beyond recognition.\n",
      "I think Casemiro is a quality player and a quality singing. I don’t believe he’ll be ‘unmotivated’ because he’s won everything. \n",
      "He’s a world class CDM which we need. But it’s madness that we’ll be paying that money for him at this point in the window. Crazy. It reeks of absolute desperation.\n",
      "With the way things are going, it will be Marouane Fellaine at 11:59pm on Deadline day.\n",
      "Quality player is Casemiro & also a DM which we've cried out for. The concern with this signing though is how much more motivation will he have to still achieve having won everything multiple times over at Madrid? We are said to pay him an eye-popping 400k a week is what I've heard & that's typical United, one of our biggest problems has been paying insane wages resulting in comfortable, unmotivated players who we then can't move on when it's time. As I say, quality player but just seems like one that may help to stabilise us a bit more again but won't helps us achieve anything substantial. As for Pulisic, I've always been quite underwhelmed by him, albeit you can see he does possess good quality. I probably wouldn't be averse to a loan though, it can't be any worse than banging our heads against a brickwall hoping Rashford does anything productive every week.\n",
      "One question I have is will Ten Hag play Casemiro when he joins United? Or will he stick to the 2 greatest midfielders ever played football Mctominay and Fred?\n",
      "The reality is that, when he was at Ajax, Ten Hag didn't choose the players. At Ajax they have a solid recruitment area full of great ex players.... At Manchester United.....🤷‍♂️\n",
      "We are a absolute mess. If Casemiro was the target why wasn't he signed 2 months ago?. We just panic and buy whoever with no strategy man. Im not saying Casemiro is a rubbish player, he is quality. Its just Man Utd's approach to signings is a joke. Plus im not overly keen on giving a 30 year old a 5 year contract at 250k a week. ( but ill literally take anything over Scott and Fred ).\n",
      "Casemiro would be a fabulous signing for us i can’t bear to watch McTominay play again\n",
      "If Casemiro joins current Man Utd, then it will be his beginning of the end of his career. Let he continue in Madrid.\n",
      "United have 2 big transfer problems right now\n",
      "\n",
      "1   literally everyone in Football knows how bad   the situation is  at United  and it means  alot of good players are simply going to refuse to go here regardless how much money we offer them Haaland is a good example \n",

      "Graham Potter is doing incredible things at brighton\n",
      "Someone forgot to tell West Ham PL started earlier this season.\n",
      "Brighton is the team people are actually sleeping on...they're in a good standing at the moment but nobody is paying attention\n",
      "Don't sleep on brighton. I would like to see them in Europe one day.\n",
      "Brighton looking good even though they lost couple good players\n",
      "Unfair because Brighton and Hove Albion have two teams against West Ham’s one.\n",
      "West ham genuinely has a solid squad… bad start to the season\n",
      "Kehrer was lucky the foul occurred on the line for a penalty, otherwise he's likely sent off for denying a goal-scoring opportunity outside of the penalty area.\n",
      "Moi and Pervis and hopefully if Sarmiento picks his level up , I hope these three Ecuadorian men play together . They sure will do a high offensive playing style .\n",
      "Brighton doing everything right, very good team\n",
      "Probably the best game I've seen from Harry Maguire in a long time. His absence from the game was pivotal in United's win.\n",
      "ten Hag was on the pitch 45 minutes before the warmup, placing cones and balls in precise spots.  His body language was full of intensity and concentration.  He looked like a man on a mission.\n",
      "This is a good coach. He's clearly a floor general and knows how to drive results. This is the guy you want you to lead your team, especially if they have been so ill-disciplined like United has for the last few years. If this was basketball, he is the type of point guard you want. He's got excellent standards and definitely the mindset of a champion.\n",
      "As a Liverpool fan I have to say that I admire how Ten Hag approached this game, he is great to listen to. Honest and intelligent. Not afraid to leave out some big egos for the greater interest of the team, respect!\n",
      "Ten hag has found the best position for maguire\n",
      "Not a single forward passed him\n",
      "Not a single mis passed ball\n",
      "Not a single foul\n",
      "Not a single defensive error leading to goal\n",
      "Keep it up maguire\n",
      "so refreshing to have a manager who's not afraid to make big decisions\n",
      "The tactical position of maguire was class 🔥\n",
      "From my point of view, the selection of Varane is decisive.\n",
      "When the defense lacks solidity, all areas of the game suffer. His presence and the quality of his interventions gave confidence to the whole team, including Martinez, who was also much more efficient.\n",
      "I wonder if in reality Varane is not the man of the match even without being the best on the field.\n",
      "Sometimes the balance of a team depends on very little.\n",
      "I loved Ten Hag's comment the other day about he has always had slow starts at every club he managed but he always got the job done. He has total belief in himself & it showed on the pitch last night that the players have belief now too!\n",
      "So now the question becomes, did they raise themselves just because it was Liverpool or has Ten Hag become the first coach in a long time at that club to actually instill an attitude shift in his players.\n",
      "People are not talking about how much of an effect the altitude had on Leon it’s crazy. Bring that belt home Rocky and defend it at Wembley another W incoming mate 🇯🇲🇬🇧\n",

      "“Look at me now!” What an iconic speech, the whole thing.\n",
      "The most amazing thing about this is how Leon shone on the mic. He's never been regarded as much of a talker, but this might be best post fight interview ever. it's got it all, cold one liners, tear jerking passion, a roaring crowd and bedlam in the stadium. watched this so many times already.\n",
      "So many people said Edwards didn't even deserve the shot. Most underrated, most disrespected fighter in the sport. Casuals with opinions. Baffling. Look at him now! Leon Edwards is the quintessential gray man/ dark horse. He does not train at altitude and EPO dope so the altitude really affected his output throughout the fight. The headkick was well read and calculated. Incredible.\n",

      "The fans support of Saliba is unreal, going back to the own goal last week. The whole fan base wants him to succeed, he could have an amazing career!\n",
      "Arteta finally getting some credibility. If Partley stays healthy and Jesus keeps his form Arsenal can challenge city for the title.\n",

      "How gorgeous is the MC20 in comparison to the 296? I love the rear 3/4 of the 296 but it's just ugly from the front. The MC20 with a MC12 livery would be my choice I think, would need the OPF's removed though to get some better sound out of it... or the Lotus and pay off my house :P :P\n",

      "Confidence isn’t “I know they’ll like me”, it’s “I’m okay if they don’t”.\n",
      "He's right. I've always loved studying the gestures and language of appealing characters and I come across as confident most of the times, to the point where people are surprised when I tell them I have anxieties and various inner struggles like we all do. It's not about feeling perfect, it's about knowing you deserve to be where you're at and accepting that you might feel uncomfortable at times.\n",
      "I think \"fake it till you make it\" is really important when it comes to confidence. You need to practice it in order for it to start coming naturally. Appearing confident, even when you don't feel confident, I believe, can prevent confrontation or becoming a victim (in some circumstances).\n",
      "Anyone who has seen an infant stare at someone unselfconsciously, or do almost anything that infants and pre-toddlers do, will understand that we are indeed born confident. I think fear and inhibition are learned, and later have to be un-learned if we are to regain our initial confidence now that we have an intellectual understanding of it.\n",
      "Honestly I feel like confidence comes naturally when you care about something so much that you are no longer sensitive to how people see you and how you appear in front of others. Like Jane Goodall or Colin Powell - I'm a person that has a mission that's important to me, plus huge experience and knowledge that built me, and I'm proud, and what the world thinks is not my concern.\n",
      "\"confidence can be very quiet\" - finally someone said it, thank you!\n",

      "I have ADHD so usually it's hard for me to focus on talks, speeches and so on. But when someone is really good at speaking and confident about what they're saying, I tend to pay more and even full attention. I paid full attention to this video and even remember what I learned after watching only once. This is my 2nd time here! Just to make sure I don't forget :)\n",

      "An important caveat is that when interviewing anyone, you need to establish a “baseline” for their individual body language. Maybe they are naturally more nervous or nervous because of the situation. So you first ask questions you already know answers to to see how they react. Watch how they move when they tell the truth. Figure out their “normal”. Then, you can ask calculated questions and see if there is deviation. You are looking for *clusters* of indicators - not isolated indicators.\n",
      "I'm glad that those \"signs\" he laid out at the beginning were myths. I've put so much effort over the years into avoiding showing these signs by accident so I don't come across as untrustworthy, and when I do them by accident I always felt like I'm somehow maliciously deceiving people or myself without knowing about it. This puts my mind at ease - self-soothing, if you will\n",

      "The guy is giving a simplified summary for total beginners and people think it is an exact account if the methods they use. Agents have spoken with innocent and guilty people, their knew how to account for simple nerves and a guilty person. They know how to establish a baseline to account for individual traits. And most importantly, none of this can be used too convict you. They can't just say \"yep he's the murderer, he is lying\" and throw you in prison. It is just a tool to help then when interrogating so they can have an idea if when they are being lied too, or who they should focus on. They still need to investigate and find actual  PROOFV to convict you. If you didn't do it, they can't convict you just because you seemed like you were lying.\n",
      "I remember I was in an argument with a friend if mine and I crossed my arms. She instantly called me out on it and said if I'm being open and honest then why did I cross my arms. Thats a defensive stance. Later I found out that this was meant and a self sooth which I find more realistic. That situation was stressful for me so crossing my arms made sense I do that when I'm anxious or upset\n",

      "I used to rush myself on the bike to school and I love cycling.. but I wanted to be there as fast as possible so that I'd have more time to study. Yet every time I would rush through, I'd be stopped at the red lights and the slower cyclers would catch up with me, making me feel frustrated with the time I was wasting waiting at the red lights. All I was left with was more sweat, frustration and muscle pain. So I decided this was not going to do it. Now I cycle every morning to school at a slow pace enjoying the nature: the rain, the sunshine, the wind, the smells of life, everything, listening to the city or the birds. I even have time to stop if I see a cat and try to give it some snacks. I arrive at school feeling relaxed and ready for the day. It's my favorite thing to do now. \n",
      "Making a priority list will make your life better. Especially the relationships and self categories. Taking time to just be present in the moment and live. Ignore the smartphone and technology as long as possible and talk to your loved ones instead. \n",

      "I like her approach and It's partly right but I do believe that the things that we want to do during the week could be postponed for other reasons too and not only because we don't count them as priorities. For example,  it's not the same having free time in the morning and having free time at 23:00. The opportunities for doing certain things are less (kids are in bed, shops are closed etc.) Also, when you want to meet other people you need to find some hours in which you are both free and it's not super easy to happen\n",

      "I know at least 5 ways to deal with them:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Never take their words personally. Always have this suspicion in mind, that they do not wish good for you, so you shouldn't trust their opinion of you.\n",
      "2. Don't compete with them. It is futile and drains your energy.\n",
      "3. If they attack you, stay calm, indifferent and if possible give them a sneaky compliment. The odds are they are used to people attacking them back and it takes them off guard when you see the positive things in them rather than the negative.\n",
      "4. Don't become them. If they are negative, be positive. If they lie, tell the truth. If they speak behind your back, speak to their face. Always lead with example, because they might not simply have the skills to do that.\n",
      "5. Do not trust them. Don't tell them personal details about your life or things they could use against you. Keep your distance and value your boundaries. Protect yourself.\n",
      "You will continue to suffer if you have an emotional reaction to everything that is said to you.  True power is sitting back and observing things with logic.  True power is restraint.  If words control you that means everyone else can control you.  Breathe, and allow things to pass.\n",
      "Repeat after me:\n",
      "\n",
      "It's safe to set boundaries with difficult people.\n",
      "No matter what they say or feel, I am safe.\n",
      "This only works if all people involved are reasonable. If one or more parties can't be reasoned with, then the problem continues. You can communicate until you're blue in the face, but if the other person isn't willing to communicate appropriately, then you've hit a brick wall.\n",
      "\"Their bad behavior shouldn't be the cause of your heart-attack.\"\n",
      "Brilliant!\n",
      "Long story short: keep the convo brief, simple, cool, calm and level headed. Only give one word answers than a full sentence. Don’t give them the benefit of the doubt. Be the bigger person and do yourself a favour and save yourself from that heartache. \n",
      "\n",
      "Trust me when I say this it works every time. Giving them a reason to whine and complain and talk about said drama only repeats itself if you give them the time and energy to do it. When they get less of that, well, the difficulty becomes easier to manage 🙃\n",
      "Cannot communicate with sociopaths on any reasonable level. People who cannot empathize will never see things from your point of view. Someone who is a sociopathic master manipulator can only be dealt with by affecting what matters most to them, money. Unfortunately, office sociopaths who gaslight daily rarely get reprimanded. They have everyone else in the office convinced they are wonderful and that you are the problem. Best solution is to remove yourself from that environment.\n",
      "I swear I need this to deal with my whole family 🥺\n",
      "This puts a whole new perspective on the way I think about others actions and my reactions. I can't change people but I can change the way I think and feel. And also asking questions is another good point, very well said!\n",

It was never enough for her to show love, only maybe enough to prevent the threats of leaving or avoid hearing that I was a complete failure.

I'm not sure if there is a good way to definitively figure out their motivations in one declaration/action, but you could run some tests over time to see which actions get rewarded and make more declarations as to your own \"motivations\" to see if that has any effect, but make them less obvious and less likely to cause the game master to completely abandon you.\n",

      "21:52 I'm pretty sure that wouldn't be enough to destroy his plan. If let's say one of the three people with the wall managed to answer the question correctly, that's still 2 options eliminated. And with how fast Shirube came up with his  first plan, he had more than enough time to devise a second test to figure which of the remaining two directions was the correct one.\n",
      "For the platform game, I think the second go was almost perfect. If he found a way to obscure his hands and ask a loaded question, then it would’ve been foolproof. Like if he kept a coin and hid it somewhere on his person, then asked everyone which hand held the coin. That’s not a perfect solution, but that’s the kind of question I’m thinking of. One where if you choose an obvious answer you know they’re lying, and the only one telling the truth would give you a third answer\n",
      "In the platform game, what if the guy asked the other people to go to the corner of the edge of the platform and reach their hand out so he can grab it. Since there's only a small opening in the center, they wouldn't be able to do it, and the distance seems to be close enough for this to work.\n",
      "This guy’s definetly a genius.\n",
      "For the spinning platform I have an easier solution, once you see which way is safe to jump, and they put the mask on, put your hand on one of the corners of the platform while facing the safe area, now when the platform rotates count how many turns it has made by feeling with your free hand the position of your hand on the corner being able to count how many rotations made gives you the idea of where you are and where to jump\n",

I finally went to the doctor and found out I had an iron deficiency, so my doctor put me on supplements and offered me an infusion and I feel so much better! So it's definitely worth getting bloodwork done and going to the doctor's on top of all these great tips :)\n",
      "My thing has been the shifting of schedules to match my chronotype. Just.. the violence of waking up at 6h30 was unbearable for me.

My blackout curtains, sleep mask, & extended release melatonin are my best friends after a shift & a hot shower!\n",
      "There was one single semester in undergrad that I was able to set my schedule up so that everyday I had a class start at 10:00 a regular lunch break and evening classes that ended by 6. And my dorm happened to be a single with a LOT of windows and natural light. Having a consistent schedule that matched my night owl rhythm and light regulation was the best sleep I ever felt (it was also the most consistent I’ve ever been in the gym since quitting high school sports) Followed by a semester where classes started at either 8:30 or 2pm on alternate days and my worst semester both grade and mental-health wise\n",

      "I really believe in everything he has just said. It is important to avoid procrastination guys. I am telling you this because of my life experience. I moved to Canada when I was 20 years old and my life has changed completely. I was studying computer engineering in my home country and was about to complete my 3rd year when my mother took the decision to move to Canada. It was really difficult at the beginning because of the language and culture. My knowledge about English was probably between 30% and 45%, so I had to invest part of time studying English.  I proposed to myself that I had to learn the language  at a university level  in 1 year, and it worked. I still need improvements, but I feel really proud of myself because I was able to learn the language. After having learned English, I applied to University of Toronto to study Computer Science,  and since the semester was going to start on September of the following year, I took that year to study everything about my career. I took my time to study advanced functions, calculus, physics and programming. What do I mean about all of this? You can learn everything you want if you really want to. The crucial part of all of this is to believe that you can do it. I personally do not believe in what the science says about the \"SPECIAL KIDS\". We all are smart beings that have the same capacities to learn everything we want. You can do it guys if you are willing to take the effort. I hope you have a great day and I wish you all the best ☺️. NEVER GIVE UP.\n",
      "What I learned is: we need to be able to deconstruct the skill, and learn enough to self assess our progress eliminating diseraction while practice time, and put our 20 hours .This was so excellent.\n",
      "The best, most exciting, most practical, most fascinating Ted talk that I continue to come back to you again and again. Read the book multiple times, applied it to everything from learning a new language to fixing up my house, to now developing my skills as a ham radio operator. Thank you so much for this.\n",

I hadn't really connected it with confidence before but I can see the connection now. Interesting. 🤔\n",

You can stand in any way you want, dress as fancy as you like and have enough money to make king Solomon blush, but if inside you’re still insecure the world will see it. Love yourself, know you’re worthy, and never let the outside effect or diminish the inside. Don’t try and be or imitate someone else, be who you are and love it. One thing this video gets right: Know you’re gonna be ok no matter what. ‘Nough said, love to you all xxx\n",

That self love and understanding allows you to stay true to yourself in every situation, that is the deepest form of confidence.\n",

      "Hi just want to say that many times ruminating is emotionally driven… there can be an uncomfortable feeling and our mind jumps in to try to either make us feel better or dwell on that feeling and feed more into it.  So shifting from our mind and into our body sensations can actually be really helpful and grounding and even illuminating.  When we ignore our feelings our body often starts shouting at us to get our attention, so just listening to what our body is saying, acknowledging the feelings and fears, can be very clarifying and soothing.\n",

      "To absorb what one reads, it's crucial to master concentration. When I started reading in my early youth, my mind would wander before finishing a page. Over time, my concentration improved to a point where I could read dozens of pages without losing my train of thought. Activities like chess, reading and meditation are effective in improving concentration. I know a Buddhist monk who can clear his mind for long periods even when in a noisy environment. It's a skill that he developed over time with practice and discipline. It's literally rewired his brain. Schools fail miserably in teaching our youth in the art of self learning.\n",
      "I was born into a relatively poor family.  Never had the opportunity to go to college.  I became obsessed with the self learning technique right out of high school.  I happened to live in a town that had one of the top 10 business schools in the US.  I would go to the University library and pour over the text books in the order they were taught.  within 18 months I had the knowledge of an MBA.  By the time I was 20 I started my own company and was a millionaire before I turned 40.  It took so long because when a guy with no formal education walks into a bank for a loan they tend to want to laugh at you.  I finally found a banker that would talk to me.  I explained my business model and told him how the current inverted yield curve would effect the time value of the money I would borrow he was floored.\n",
      "Be a teacher but forever a student. Listening in itself is a lost art. So difficult to run across a good listener. Joe Rogan comes to mind. I really enjoy the interviews he has conducted with Elon as his guest. I don't necessarily agree with Elon on many things but he seems sincere and takes his time trying to explain his thoughts. What I like about Joe is he gives his guest's time to speak without interrupting them with his own beliefs ( or agenda like so many on the tell a vision).  Being a good listener takes practice but well worth the effort.\n",

      "As an undergrad, I had to take history, and I'm an math/science person who hates history. On my own, I learned to rearrange stories in my head to make it make sense to me. I would exchange real people with people I knew to relate to the topics. I scores a hundred on about every exam when most were struggling. The nstructor made a comment that it was one person who always scored a hundred. They were like who who because there's no way. His tests were long. When I told them what I was doing to remember the content, they laughed, but I was like it works. And believe it or not, I still remember most of it and that was 22 years ago.\n",

      "Everybody, you can take any variety of quinoa from the store meant to be cooked and plant the seeds. I have done this in California many times and have grown several varieties of quinoa. It takes a small field to get enough to sell but a few plants will give you a few cups of dried grain you can cook for a few meals and some seed to save for next year and the leaves are edible too and can be cooked like spinach. The next time you go shopping at a store that sells quinoa plant a few of the grains. You can even grow it as a houseplant but beware, it grows several feet tall and wide and is prone to falling over when the flowers get heavy. If you try to grow this plant just pause this video and look at the ground they are growing it in. It likes to grow in a mixture of compacted dirt, crumbled rock, and sand in a very hot place where it's occasionally watered. That's what you wanna put in your flower pot and reproduce. Mine grew well in a place where there used to be a gravel walkway that had been overgrown with thistles and nothing else for years. Please grow your own quinoa even if just for fun. It would be a cool school science project to do with kids, the stuff is like a weed and grows in conditions other food sources do not.\n",
      "I never even heard of the royal variety and I love Quinoa.\n",
      "That pink dust flying everywhere looks wild. It’s so amazing that this crazy nutritious stuff grows out in salt flats where nothing else grows, the plant turns barren earth into highly nutritious food! So cool!\n",
      "To the ones saying that its their fault for over-exploiting quinoa production:\n",
      " Bolivia is the poorest country in all of south america, rural people, especially indigenous people living in the Altiplano literally dont have enough money to live a propper life. The quinoa boom meant that thousands of families could aford education, bettering its living standars and getting out of poverty. \n",
      "Its really easy to talk about how unsustainable their practices where when your country got rich trough just as unsustainable practices plus the exploitation of millions of human beings...\n",
      "One very nutritious food with one very beautiful scenery. You can't miss that beautiful scenery in the background.\n",
      "Watching this made me want to eat quinoa now. I’ve never tried it. I wonder how it compares to rice.\n",
      "This thing grows in my garden, I always thought it was alien vegetation. Never knew it was edible\n",

The 1 in a million. The perfect alighted moment in time. I would’ve thought there would be more positive, i spirited or constructive comments… this is so sad.

I will say, however, that I want you guys to get back to this guy and see how he's doing in a couple years. This guy definitely thinks big and I love that. He is such a huge inspiration. I have started my affiliate marketing and already made $7k in just 6 months. It's nothing compared to the amount of money he makes, but we will get there for sure. \n",

All residential, we have a van , a paint sprayer and a powerwasher  and a bunch of ladders and basic other supplies.  Get good at something nobody wants or has time to do and you'll always be busy.

Don't forget to invest in your knowledge and your business' improvement, rather than on growing profits alone.\n",
      "I worked at a large Grocery Store for 4.5 years. Upstairs in the break room they had a soda and two candy/ chip vending machines. They were owned by a local outside company that did a TON of vending machines in this area.. I asked the GM... why not spend a couple grand and SAVE a tone of money, we are a grocery store, WE sell everything in these, and could cut the cost in half and still make a profit. She agreed and walked away.\n",

      "Where I live I have NEVER seen a betting shop close down - one round the corner from me has been open for over 50 years. There's a constant stream of customers going into these places and even with internet competition they still seem to thrive. Betting shops is where I would strongly consider investing it. Cigarettes is another one, BAT share price just goes up and up. Warren Buffet loves the tobacco industry and who can blame him with those huge profits. Even with all the bad write up about the dangers of smoking people still do it as it's so highly addictive. Two businesses that just don't fail - betting shops and cigarettes, they even have a strong link !\n",
      "Love the breakdown. I've gradually built my finance and made my first $100k through investing which i've used to start my jewellery business, and with what I’ve learned over a decade investing, given enough time, solid investments have the potential to double the initial principal amount, but many investors are instead attracted to the lure of high yields in short periods of time despite the possibility of unattractive losses before even getting out. So the onus is on newbies to beware. Having multiple income streams helped me stay afloat in business when the pandemic broke out.\n",

      "If you are going to start a vending business, giving customers the option to use cards will increase your sales a ton. Fewer people carry cash, especially in small denominations. The customer with larger bills will not use your machines until they break their bill at another retailer. Which will likely have snacks and drinks at their POS for impulse purchases.\n",
      "I live in a rural area.  Agriculture is a very high risk business that takes enormous upfront investment.  Yes, food will always be needed, but mother nature is notoriously unreliable and global markets are fickle.  This is the reason large corporate entities are and have taken over the family farm which has brought on the deaths of countless small towns.\n",

      "Isn't it just glorified fashion illustration? Essentially these are 3D drawings that's it :) Actual fashion and the beauty of it is conquering your fashion sketches, conquering your elaborate ideas by overcoming physical obstacles. That is one of the main reason we love fashion. To draw an haute couture dress is somewhat easy, but to make it, is beyond hard. Making a dress is a journey for all the people involved, that is how innovation happens. These animated pieces remind me the 80s licensing craze or something of sort :) It is a great new avenue for fashion houses to bank easy money. It is not the future of fashion, it is just a new market for fashion to expand. Silly gimmicks bringing big buck, that's about it :)\n",

      "Love the breakdown. I started my first business from money I made off dividends. With what I’ve learned over a decade investing, given enough time, solid investments have the potential to double the initial principal amount, but many investors are instead attracted to the lure of high yields in short periods of time despite the possibility of unattractive losses before even getting out. So the onus is on newbies to beware. Having multiple income streams helped me stay afloat in business when the pandemic broke out.\n",

Financial management is a crucial topic that most tend to shy away from, and ends up haunting them in the near future.

The best quote I heard was \"Nobody is expecting you to do something amazing, but it is amazing when you do something\".  The reality is you might not build a multi billion dollar business that is global, but you might build something that brings value, and that is why we get into business to test ourselves our own ability and to be different.  You can only admire what Elon Musk has achieved and the potential of where technology could take us in the future.\n",

      "Great video.  But let me talk about something important, I see many young and old make mistakes that I think should not be.  I believe that everyone, young or old, should have an investment plan that increases their financial returns from three figures to six figures.  The investment can be your retirement plan or future plan, depending on what you want, but what matters most is that you have an investment that is profitable.\n",
      "It's touching to hear Elon talk about wanting to bridge a gap between the genetically unfortunate with intelligence augmentation. My mother has a hereditary severe brain disease that affected her life & disabled her. The impact of her brain health affected my development/life and my brain health. The genetic component also affected my brain health. Currently I'm functionally disabled from it too. It's a constant chronic hell cycle. It's comforting to know someone out there as dedicated and capable as Elon Musk is thinking about disadvantaged people like my mother & I.\n",

      "It< makes sense,  BTC and crypto is off helping to regulate, rather than pretend it won't ever happen.  The big institutions getting in is the catalyst that will launch us into the stratosphere.  Most people don't like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize.   The projects that initiated the process of regulation have not been ruined, they got involved in setting guidelines and helping the regulators understand the crypto space. I’d get involved more knowing that I have made over 7 btc and 15ETH from day-trade with Leroy Davids Crypto in few weeks\n",
      "As you can see we are already in August and I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just naïve, the sphere have seen far worse times than this, enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions, I'd say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding. Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 9.2 BTC when I started at 3.5 BTC  in just few weeks implementing trades with signals and insights from LIBERTON CORP would advise y’all to trade your asset rather than hold for a future you aren't sure about.\n",
      "Although< I have interests in global economics I don't watch the news anymore... I have enough FUD.  Thanks for this news and offering your insight on how to navigate during unfortunate times/events like this.  You're right about keeping level headed when investing so that's why I think it's important to limit the amount of FUD we consume.  I don't watch the media but the news that you present has enough to know issues going on without riding the emotional rollercoaster if I were to watch the news everyday.  Now I buy and just trade long term more than ever, I have made over £728k from day trading with Liberton Corp Signal in few weeks, this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish....\n",
      "LIBERTONCORP is young.  Holding almost anything mentioned here is a good hold because the VHS or Beta will only show in time.  I want to hold them early.  Its sad that most dont think of these things as good future holds instead of being out of the market and bottom hunting.  Are we the adopters or are we scavengers?  surely one of these layer ones will become the standard and i dont want to sell any of them too early.\n",
      "I sincerely appreciate the work you've done and the knowledge you share. Technical analysis can be helpful, but I think It is quite puzzling that well-known cryptocurrency YouTubers just pay attention to pure T.A and entirely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is inflating and why the outlook for the future is even more encouraging than it seems. Ignoring the reality that each ETF launch to this point has caused a sizable decline from BTC highs is somewhat dangerous. We were already in a perilous position and only survived a protracted bear market due to historically low volume and nearly  whale pumps. Day trading should be given greater consideration because it is less affected by the market's situation.  trading daily with LIBERTONCORP I have earned over $ 12BTC using his insights and charts. His insight has always been a step ahead of others..\n",
      "When referencing corporate America, he said “They don’t really care about you as they make it seem” realest thing he said...I’ve seen experienced it first hand in the DMV.

      "keep <,up the great work. You are truly an asset to the community. Thanks, for all you do! I like your truthful coverage. BTC's price has been fluctuating lately, buying isn't a tough call, but it is a very tough call to figure out what to do aside holding. The good thing about the space is that you can buy the dips and put them into active trades, while confidently waiting for a pump in price because it is inevitable. Most people do not understand how the space works. Your advantage in understanding chart won't guarantee what an asset is going to do. Prices will go up or down. Nevertheless, the market has been so profitable despite price ups and down. I've always played safe implementing trades with insights and signals from a renowned trader, LIBERTONCORP . I made 12BTC from this recent crash and despite the ups and down in the market I’m still bagging more money\n",

      "High fashion is sometimes very abstract, very elitist, very bizarre and sometimes purely ridiculous. But if you push all of the crazy price tags aside and all the ridiculous celebrity endorsers too, you find artisans, people who study and excel in a craft. They deserve to be highlighted more. Behind that overpriced Chanel bag is a leather/chain/fabric artisan and years of creative thought and passion. Fast fashion is slowly killing our planet (water consumption, landfills, toxic chemical dumped in village waters, people paid pennies etc), haute couture is rare, it’s scarce. I find the luxury scene beyond ridiculous but I love my high end pieces, that have lasted me years and will continue to do so. Behind these fashion shows are artisans, that will always be better than any fast producing machine.\n",
      "Imran interviews the most powerful individuals in the fashion industry; but I truly believe he holds just as much influence. This series is exactly what the industry needs in terms of consumers listening and fellow designers/industry professionals taking note. Imran is the projector of those poignant words and as a collective it holds much greater power.\n",
      "Luxury fashion is one of the world's biggest industries. I think this is a great topic for a Bloomberg series. I would be interested is seeing more of this type of content. I am particularly interested in the recent collaboration between Gucci and Balenciaga, especially now that I know they both come under the Kering umbrella. Other recent collaborations include Versace and Fendi, which could be the subject of another video. The more recent video in this series examines the Chinese market, and how fashion brands are now targeting young Asian consumers.\n",
      "The worst thing to happen to fashion was ‘influencers’ who encourage always wanting the next instead of appreciating the now and the classic. They’re so fickle and encourage everyone else to be the same.\n",
      "I love how “luxury” is about preserving the craft and labor of the poor for the rich. Like what really is the point here? Is it the small artisans who get $$ and praise or the fashion “houses” and companies that actually get to design,  exploit labor, and sell for profit? 🥱 The definition just isn’t strong enough for me to care.\n",
      "I used to love high fashion, but the more I learn about what goes on in the industry the more I feel like pursuing a different career choice, so much nepotism, elitism, and lack of creativity. it’s almost as if you don’t fit within certain enclaves, you’re not welcomed.\n",
      "I love the new sustainability efforts, excited to see new changes!\n",
      "people are really stuck on the price tags and not understanding that couture is only made to order by experts in their fields. that's what this video is looking at. These pieces are art, and art is different for everyone. just because you don't like this version of art doesn't make you better than those who do. I could never afford these pieces but that doesn't stop me from really appreciating the vision behind it.\n",
      "What annoys me the most is that these so called a majority of these high class fashion brands exploit their workers with long hours and little pay even though they are selling products for an extremely high price tag.\n",

      "Wish Kyle and his crew all the luck to always bring home king salmon every time they go out to fish for it\n",

      "Hamza, I just wanted to say thank you, brother. I know this will probably be lost in the comments but from the bottom of my heart, you have given me the tools and strategies to save myself from taking my own life. 6 months ago I was in a very dark place and had just gotten out of an abusive relationship and had no will to live. I randomly stumbled upon your channel and have applied all of the tools, strategies and philosophies you teach since then. I truly would not be here without you, and I am so grateful for you. I now have a purpose and direction in my life, outside of the YouTube videos I watch like yours that have high ROI on my time, I am off social media completely. I'm 17 years old and I'm still at the very beginning of my manhood but to anyone reading this, it gets better. Happiness, peace and prosperity take time, hard work and a lot of effort. But it is so worth it. I am now leading those around me to this way of life and building up my brothers and community. I just today did my first cold approach and it went well. If anyone is struggling with mental health issues or feeling purposeless in life, put in more effort and combat life itself in every way you can, things will get better for you if you choose the difficult path that builds strong men.\n",
      "Thanks for having me on the stream Hamza, I wish I said more and I wish I was more clear with my words... but I was nervous. Anyways I rewatched the chat and had a good laugh, saw a lot of toxicity and criticism but all is welcome, the chat was really funny and any criticism I got I deserved. Thanks again Hamza, this was an awesome opportunity to talk to you even if we didn’t talk mainly about the subject we were supposed to. Enjoy life.\n",
      "These 3 men are on the right path.\n",
      "Thanks again for your time Hamza. I still can't remember how I stumbled on your channel, but you've given me good info that keeps me on the right path, and you've helped me value my masculinity for the first time in years. I'll be sure to let you know if there's any updates on my situation!\n",

      "I remember watching a documentary about how the area of West Africa had become a dumping ground for used/unwanted clothes from Europe and the Americas; more specifically the North Americas. I was totally shocked and had no idea about this.

Most of it just became literal mountains of clothes on the beaches and wherever.\n",

      "The only issue is that the majority of customers are re-sellers. So most consumers aren’t getting the discount. But either way it helps the environment which is great.\n",
      "It’s buyer behavior. It goes beyond buying up multiple sizes to see what fits. I’ve sold on eBay for years with no issue. Same individual item again and again. One year I sold on Amazon and I was blown away by the types of buyers I had. Many requested a cancellation of purchase, which I gladly did. I don’t want to have to pay for return shipping due to a mistake the buyer made. Many also requested a return claiming the item was defective, but when I paid for the item to be shipped back to me due to Amazons return policies, the item would be returned in perfect working condition. I don’t know if people are buying suggested items without thinking, or assuming they’ll get something free if they complain, but I can’t imagine the horror if I had to trash every single return I got. Sometimes, after paying for the return shipping label, the buyer would never ship. All they had to do was print off the label and schedule a pickup, but the act of deciding to keep it without any further communication beyond return approval makes me believe they were after a freebie.\n",

In just a few moments time, if you believe it, is all God requires, believe it.  Forget about your past.  When they put Jesus in that tomb, they put all of your sins in that tomb as well.  When Jesus walked out of that tomb, He walked out victorious and we came out with Him a new creation in Christ Jesus.\n",

      "Thank you so much for this! I had an easy time following the pace of the course. Also, the examples and exercises were great! With 30-60 minutes per day, I could complete the course in 5 days. Good Stuff!\n",
      "Most logical and very easy-to-understand course content. His way of explaining is incomparable to anyone in his profession, and the topic is covered vividly and never feels bored. I gained so strong knowledge immensely in a tiny time. Hat off to the professor. You're the great teacher to me I ever had in this field, sir. Best wishes for your future tutorials and life as well.\n",
      "Excellent practical course for someone who knows only the very minimal basics, if that. Well modulated and articulated.  Designed for adult self learners. Easy to follow and it is a  plus that you did not use \"techie' language.  Your presentation style made it easy to follow without distractions. Real life examples are a plus.  Application of knowledge always enhances learning. Looking forward to your next course.\n",
      "I'm about 30 minutes in and I gotta admit, you are brilliant at organizing what you want to teach. You've managed to organize even zooming in and out at specific intervals to teach all those small aspects of the program. Really cool! I never knew excel was so intuitive either.\n",
      "This was an excellent class, well done in organization, methods and process.  There are lots of tools out there but this class is better because problems are solved as examples are worked out.  In this way it keeps your attention while deepening the learning.\n",

      "One hour into this video, and I have learned more about how to use APIs and Postman than I have with tons of other videos -- COMBINED! I can't see how video instruction can get better than this. All the money I have spent to learn this and actually understand it, and this video instructor provides the most precise explanation I have seen to date! EXCELLENT WORK!\n",
      "There is so much thought process and hard work put in by the content creators! We need this kind of content more so that students feel more confident learning newer things! I have become a huge fan of the channel...hats off to you guys! Keep doing this great work!\n",
      "Here I am, employed as a developer, watching a video that purports to be for beginners, and it's a great video so far. One of the things I love about approaches like this is that, especially for developers like me who just picked up some crap over time and am doing stuff with it, there are lots of fundamentals that slip through those autodidactic cracks. For instance, I _know_ what \"statelessness\" means generally, but then at around 23:30 Craig explains not only clearly but completely enough for the context--with no extraneous details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice work.\n",
      "You guys make learning fun! The fact that you went over APIs in a broad sense and not just web-based really nailed home what an API really is. Wow!\n",
      "I'm enjoying your tutorial a lot, but a side note: I think its recommended to invoke pip as python -m pip because it is more portable. Having recently had issues due to Windows10 and trying, naively, to just invoke pip on its own I thought it would be worth mentioning, especially since this is aimed at beginners who might struggle with issues like that. Cheers!\n",
      "This was truly a whirlwind introduction to API's. I believe it was a little more harder for me as I haven't started to learn JAVA yet (still learning Python). But none less, this is an extremely well done course. Thank you Craig for your work and I will now take another rest as I've reached the end to unscramble my brain.\n",
      "This is easily the best course in this section. Hats of to this guy. Didnt feel like boring bombarment of information. Enjoyed every moment of it.\n",
      "Such an approachable manner of teaching Craig, thank you. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even as a refresher for me, I just felt compelled to keep listening through... \n",
      "\n",
      " Am sure this has been extremely useful for introducing newcomers into coding no end!\n",

It will select that element and save you from multiple (and very annoying) clicks. This was a big game changer for me that I learned while using Sketch. Works on Figma too.\n",

      "I agree with you on taking a good inch it’s what makes it look blurry instead of compressed darkness because they do half an inch instead this is the same reason why I choose to watch your tutorials.

Love you guys a ton and i honestly hope this helps anyone & everyone out there looking to get better at editing photos! I cant wait to see what you guys can do after this! Feel free to leave any future videos you want to see in the comments, and ill add em to the list!! Have a great sunday!!! - Sawyer\n",

This is not only a work flow tutorial but also a fundamental guide/manual of the software and explains what works how.

Best haircut I've had in years. So thanks Brand Mondo!\n",

Being an expert at building requires near perfect understanding of the basics, ie what they are and how to execute them. You need to understand most if not all of the simple concepts there are, have a huge amount of tricks and ideas saved up for detailing and really anything for that matter, often times even understand things like color theory. There is way too much to becoming a good builder to fit into a single video, especially an 8 minute one.

      "I love that she used her own products but didn't talk about it for 10 mins and just introduced them like all of the other products that she used. I love her so much! What a queen!\n",
      "Her skin is literally perfect, she's so passionate about self care & skin care. Makes sense why she chose to start the skin care brand instead of makeup. I absolutely love her skin. Congratulations on rhode, Hailey 🥂💓\n",

      "👁️👄👁️\n",
      "Hey, just wanna let you know, I used your tutorials to learn and now 4 weeks later I can almost perfectly juggle about 10~15 times. Still a long way to go, but really amazing tutorials and it was a lot of fun, the journey. Thanks a lot!\n",
      "I've never been able to juggle more than two things in my whole life until now! Taylor makes it so easy to understand! Great tips! Thank you SO much! Self esteem improved +10 pts!\n",
      "Hey Taylor!  It’s been a while since I watched this video.  I was talking to Joe DiNoto and he said I should let you know that, you are the reason I can juggle today.  Your explanations are great and it was something I always thought were just beyond my ability.  So thank you and please keep up the amazing work.  :)\n",
      "I really like the way you teach! Got my juggling balls... now I’m going to start practicing. By the way, I am 66 years old and I want to do this to keep my brain working well.\n",
      "Thank you really much! A great thing to learn during lockdown times :)\n",
      "Thanks - really clear instructions with great does and don'ts. I'm finally learning to actually juggle - at 67 years old!\n",
      "Thank you so much for your videos, Taylor!!  Juggling has always helped me deal with anxiety..keeps my mind focused.  It's awesome to learn some new tricks!!  Thank you for the inspiration you give!!\n",

      "This means that mobile + bedrock players can play Education Edition without paying more than what Minecraft actually costs.\n",

      "I love it 😀\n",
      "The border blocks are also available outside of education edition (at least in bedrock they are) and are accessible through the /give command\n",
      "The feature I love most about education edition is the chalkboards. They are so much easier to type on, give you more room to type, and you can go back and edit them.\n",
      "Mannn, I really wish they'd bring some of these awesome items over to the java edition! Colored torches and sparklers? Balloons?! Plus there are Pocket edition items I wish they'd bring over too!\n",
      "Back when I used pocket edition I used a lot of these. Glad to know they’re being recognized!\n",
      "Glad to see education is getting some attention sure it’s the version made for learning but it has probably some of the best map making features out of all minecraft versions\n",
      "I used to play MCEE in school all the time before the pandemic! Even though my teacher probably hated me and all the kids that played games during class, I couldn't help but notice all the anazing things in this version of Minecraft, I basically forgot all about it until I watched this video. It was basically free as it's obtainable to anyone with a school laptop. The laptops were on a LAN so we'd be able to join other player's worlds like parkour, hungergames, or minigames.\n",
      "I actually think that Blaze Rods could be used with Glow Ink Sacs to make glow sticks if Java/Bedrock were to have them.\n",
      "Ed edition is SO good, it's just sad that it doesn't get much recognition online. Also, the Agent can be used as a portable inventory by spawning it, placing the items in it's inventory and then you can despawn it or just leave it, then resummon it later!\n",
      "From what I know, these features are also available in Bedrock Edition. It's optimized/you can get all features of Education Edition in desktop/laptop/pc devices. But in mobile, you can get most items but not all like the camera, portfolio are not there.\n",

I know Vanilla Tweaks has a resource to have them be invisible to me, but that doesn't mean EVERYONE isn't seeming my base just SURROUNDED in beams. Maybe they could make tinted glass function as a \"beam nullifier\" while still maintaining effects? That'd be nice.\n",

      "6:36 Yeah she should’ve tested the henna before, because henna usually stays for a week few days, depends how long you keep it on for or how much you apply. I also think that instead of rubbing it off paper she should’ve washed her face. Every time I get henna done on my hands I wash my hands I don’t wipe it off, some people wipe it off too but wiping is better for your hands, when you apply henna you should wash your face. Maybe cause she didn’t wash her face it turned out like, or maybe because she should’ve just tested it out.\n",

My 2 cents -get an advisor to keep you accountable and aid you make better decisions, Carolyn Halles has been helping me a lot, all through my journey. I find it better to pay a little bit more for peace of mind than worry about money or market trends and still get burned.\n",

      "The two major nuclear disasters happened because of 1 incompetence (Chernobyl) and 2 natural disaster (Fukushima). As a British citizen I would say, that on the most part, we are very capable of preventing those two things. We’ve wasted 30 years of nuclear understanding and fine tuning in my opinion, let’s get those plants running baby.\n",
      "I think anyone who has spent time working in a modern, agile corporate environment could tell you the crux of the problem in an instant: we no longer plan past the next quarter.  \"Supply chain bottleneck\" is just another way of saying that we let the beancounters run the show, and they were good at it right until something happened which they could neither model nor predict (cerveza).   The system is brittle by design, because it's so much cheaper that way.    Nuclear energy runs counter to this business ethos:  it's a huge engineering lift, it takes 20 years to pay itself off, you need a trained workforce with domestic production and fabrication capacity that can forge the parts, machine them, weld them, then certify and maintain them over a period of 40+ years.  Instead we've been gleefully shutting profitable factories at home, gutting workforces, funneling everyone into college resulting in massive brain drain / skill loss as the old timers machinists retire, but hey, we delivered a lot of value for shareholders.   And now the chickens are coming home to roost.\n",
      "Germany acted foolishly when decommissioning so much nuclear when it was providing so much clean energy. Their CO2 emissions would likely be much lower if they kept them around plus they would have more energy independence. Personally I am a big fan of nuclear as it provides the kind of reliable, concentrated energy production that fossil fuel based systems offer, but without the emissions. Renewables require so much land and raw materials and produce relatively small amounts of energy compared to nuclear/fossil fuels. I would far rather have a nuclear power plants replace existing coal and gas plants, using the same small plots of land. With Renewable, it requires covering vast amounts of land with solar/wind in order to collect the highly defuse energy source that is wind/solar. This land should be used for farming or nature preserves, not renewables.  If the solar is using worthless land, such as the desert maybe it makes senses, but that has its own problems of longer transmission lines and more frequent cleaning/maintenance needed due to the dust. Offshore wind also resolves the land use problem, but the costs of maintaining 100s of windmills in the extremely harsh ocean environment are very high. Not to mention ruining the view of ocean front properties.\n",

      "Hmm... You know? When you remove others' independence, you are supposed to make them dependent on *you.* You aren't supposed to weaken yourself.\n",
      "Nuclear is a great carbon-free base load electricity source. I’d like to see it not as a competition but rather a companion to renewables in the future electrical generation portfolio. On the downside, nuclear is expensive to build and insure, but the actual watts  generated are among the cheapest. There are also concerns about the total available uranium to run the reactors, and it seems like we’ll have enough of it for 50-100 years if we generate 40-50% of the energy from nuclear. On top of that, thorium reactors could be a viable alternative to their uranium counterparts. Another new direction in nuclear is small modular reactors (4th gen) which in theory should be much cheaper to build and run, making initial investment lower. They would also give us greater agility in planning the electrical grid.\n",
      "So impressed Marko has made a video regarding energy use in the EU. It is useful to view the data from just a futures point of view, which is how companies plan on future availability.  Way to keep up the good work Marko! BTW - nuclear energy has been overlooked for the last 30 years and needs to come back. It is sad how German and French embraced nuclear energy then pulled back which leaves them open to the crisis now. America should take heed.\n",
      "Excellent video, Marko! Things look really bad for now. Just recently it was reported that Germans (among many others, probably) already spend their savings to fight inflation (instead of having their salaries rise to cover it). I don't want to imagine what will happen in the winter when the energy bills will really increase, or when those savings run out.\n",

      "Hi Marko! I'm living in the Germany (not born though) and have been following your podcast because you do good analysis.  Honestly, as a european, I feel quite disappointed by everything. I understand why the administration decided not to invest in nuclear energy after Fukushima accident, but on the other hand I cannot understand how they didn't invest in other resources, or should I say how the Europe, especially Germany didn't diversify when it comes to energy suppliers. It's like you said, they just ignored that fact, even though we already had a couple of years ago possible no delivery situation with Russia.\n",

There is no other option but to keep tightening money supply until inflation back to sustainable level. This is the effect of 20 years of horrific monetary policy (QE + too much stimulus). The FED added 25 trillions of debt to it balance sheet since 2000 and all the plans to reduce it deficit have failed and in the contrary they continue to increase the deficit each year. They can blame the Ukraine War or COVID that caused inflation but the reality is just poor monetary policy made by the central government over decades. The only question left is how much tightening they can do without causing a hard recession in an already vulnerable economy.\n",

HE did this, not Atozy or Coffeezilla, HE put his reputation on the line instead of ignoring it and letting it roll off his back.\n",

      "I< appreciate the content you put out on YouTube. I enjoy watching your videos.  I respect you for applying your experience and knowledge into an investment decision and putting your neck on the line by making it public. You may be right on this trade, but if you are right, you better also short the US market as well. Because if the Chinese market collapses, it will pull down the US market with it! Thanks Buddy. Previously Bitcoin has been fluctuating between the $20K and $25K price marks. Billions of dollars have been wiped off due to the crash in its price, particularly in the last four weeks. The loss has become the primary cause of several firms’ liquidation issues in the crypto industry. I think the direction is upward movement, with a bit of silence before the storm, agree it's boring for the past few days. a good strategy for hoddler'ss moving forward would be to buy now, and not get too excited to sell off with the upturn, the rise will surprise everyone. As for traders, you make money anyways, in both directions so just befriend the trend and use marketspotter to make informed decisions. If you’re a modern investor then your main aim I guess would be to take home profits for yourself and family especially during times like this when reading the charts are extremely difficult due to its chronic volatility. Well good-news you don’t have to worry about how this will come about just commit your investments with Mrs. Robin Moore and the rest will be a good history of profits for you. I have been able to day trade my bitcoin to atop 17.03 BTC with 5.07 BTC with her trade signal despite the state of the market. Her trade signal yield a lot of dividend only if you are paying attention to her instructions. The good thing of this strategy is that whatever happens we have an opportunity to make some money trading with it not minding the sideways in the crypto market.

      "Your channel has truly changed my life. i've been studying and researching about crypto for a while now and i got stuck at some point on the learning curve. now i can say I'm truly improving my understanding of this whole new world and making great profit weekly, all thanks to you ❤️\n",
      "I came here to learn how to invest after listening to a guy on radio talk about the importance of investing and how he made $460,000 in 4 months from $160k, somehow this video has helped shed light on some things, but I'm still confused, I'm a newbie and I'm open to ideas.\n",
      "I <,watch your videos for your real talks and you never disappoint.. Keep going. You've reminded me of what someone once said The mind is the man, the poor is in it and the rich is it too\". This sentence is the secret of most successful investors. I once attended similar and ever since then I have been waxing strong financially and I most tell you the truth. The bulls have been in control of the market for more than a month. They have managed to push the price by more than 100%. The majority of this rally has been without a considerable correction, begging the question if one is pending following the test of the critical $2K level. One thing is certain, nobody knows what is going on. Our leadership in the country couldn’t be any worse, from the press to the feds, they are all terrible. They say you can’t time the market, but this one was easy to see coming. Every man , woman and child no matter the age needs financial assistance. Doesn’t matter if your young or old we all need the stimulus check / checks ASAP. That's the major reason why one have to invest in crypto but not only investing rather invest and trade your assets for the gains. It's unfair on how things have turned up to be due to inflation, things has been so difficult but BTC/ETH trading has helped me maintain financial stability. Although I believe that the benefits of successful trading come from an expert and that is why I made huge profits with the help of Mr. James Wilson, he is a genius and that is why I always advise beginners/investors to trade with professionals like him. So far I have been able to increase my crypto trading portfolio from day trading from 1.07 btc to atop 13.01 btc with the accurate trading signal provided to me by James and I'm an attestant to the accuracy of his trading strategy. You all in search of a way to recover your looses from the crash and accumulate more profits can reach out to him for mentorship and profitable trading system on ͲeIєɠɾαm👉 (Jameswilson21)   Cheers thank me later\n",

      "Great content, I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just naïve, the sphere have seen far worse times than this, enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions, I'd say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding. Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 10.2 BTC when I started at 3.5 BTC  in just few weeks copying and implementing trades with signals and insights from  Feven Lena. I would advise y’all to trade your asset rather than hold for a future you aren't sure about..👌\n",

I don't have any Alts as I'm a bit of a BTC Maxi, but that said, if BTC hasn't died before, it surely won't do so now.  Stick in there - yes we are all feeling the pain, but over the long run this will just be a blip.

Several factors are driving negative sentiment in the stock and crypto markets right now including inflation, a shaky stock market, rising interest rates, and recession fears. As a result, bitcoin has dropped significantly from its all-time high, breaking below several key technical levels. As a crypto investor, the current situation might seem bleak.

      "I< think the difference in this instance is that analyst’s are stating that we are heading for a DEPRESSION! so this changes everything in the grand scheme of things when talking about possible new ATH’s. Great points in your video. I agree and suspect it may be too convenient to think BTC is perfectly correlated to S&P/Nasdaq and Altcoins to BTC. Refreshing to hear reasonable market analysis that takes a bigger picture perspective. So many people are squabbling over timing the exact bottom. That short term thinking is such a rookie mistake. By dollar cost averaging and holding for several years it takes the guess work out. Next bull run it won't be a huge deal if we bought at 21k or 17k. What will matter is that we are accumulating while the price is relatively low. I'm really holding on for this possible low point reentry, I screwed up some time back & i need this lower point to get back in, i've small cash on the sideline I don't like that but i refuse to fomo in. Our younger investors are scared, they're concerned about what they should do because a lot of them have not been through this before. My advise to them is this, go all out into trading. Trading is where the bucks are been made. I see the stock market, housing values going down, and crypto going up. Traditional markets are getting recked. The new economy is crypto, not fiat. People want truth, not corruption, contracts not monetary easing. Venturing into crypto trading investment has been a turning point for me with the help and tutoring from my investment Advisor Mrs. Robin Moore.

      "I <,have watched you for the past 2 years, and found you to be really down to earth and no frills. Congrates mate and stay real and love the fact you share your loses and wins. Good luck. Bitcoin price recently completed a two-month surge that resulted in a price increase to over $25,000; consequently, investors are now concentrating on the cryptocurrency’s next target price. Billions of dollars have been wiped off due to the crash in its price, particularly in the last four weeks. The loss has become the primary cause of several firms’ liquidation issues in the crypto industry. I think the direction is upward movement, with a bit of silence before the storm, agree it's boring for the past few days. a good strategy for hoddler'ss moving forward would be to buy now and trade not to just seat like a baby seater and watch, and not get too excited to sell off with the upturn, the rise will surprise everyone. As for traders, you make money anyways, in both directions so just befriend the trend and use marketspotter to make informed decisions. If you’re a modern investor then your main aim I guess would be to take home profits for yourself and family especially during times like this when reading the charts are extremely difficult due to its chronic volatility. Well good-news you don’t have to worry about how this will come about just commit your investments with and trade with my investment Advisor Mrs. Robin Moore trade signal and the rest will be a good history of profits for you.

      "< first got into BTC back in 2016 and have been hodling/buying assets at different price points since.  I've been through corrections before and will likely experience more over the future.  Volatility is simply the price one needs to pay if they want to play.  I don't have any Alts as I'm a bit of a BTC Maxi, but that said, if BTC hasn't died before, it surely won't do so now.  Stick in there - yes we are all feeling the pain, but over the long run this will just be a blip.  This is how I see past corrections when I felt that I got in at a high (back then I think it was less than $1000 and bouncing all over the place!).  Now when I look back, all I see is regret for not having the courage in buying more at those times. But if you believe BTC has value, then by all means, buy the dips if you can afford to.  For those who got in at 60 or 70K and feeling the crunch:  hang in there.  BTC is not a get rich quick scheme.  Wait it out and you will see:  you will come away stronger.

      "<I love the grounded reality of this channel,<I started in crypto in August 2017 ,and I bought in.I was up 5x by December only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch the original investment go down by about 85% during the ensuing 4 year bear market. I took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 4 years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do. I wish I had bought more. I am in profit for now but I am planning on using my experience and what i have learnt from Dickson Jenkins.have learned from you and other Youtubrs especially my mentor Dickson Jenkins. who taught me how to make trade and increase my crypto from 2btc to 13btc that no one really knows what is going to happen in the market and I know you are only saying what you think will happen based on the past. It is yours and my opinion so people should make their own investment choices based on their own research.....\n",

      "I < must say that you are the most erudite and smart analyst in the crypto space. First of all, you're just awesome! I've been following for months now and the cinematic videos, excellent insight and comedic tone are outstanding. Before anything else, I would like to say that no one can exactly predict in days how long a bear or bull market could last or how low and high the prices can go, but we can try to make predictions using past events, I think prices should run up a lot now, punishing panic sellers and forced sellers. Most new traders struggle at first to make sense of the markets and how to put their portfolios in a position to flourish. Many try to start on their own and quickly end up with a string of losses, slowly seeing their accounts dwindle to what they started off as. Everyone is looking at the bitcoin price action from a 2021 bull run perspective. Everything has changed…we are in a recession, facing stagflation, rising rates, and energy shortages driving food and living costs through the roof, breaking consumers’ backs. <There are different strategies to profit from the crypto market but holding and waiting for a major pump is not the best way to earn profits off the market, smart investors trade and take short-term profits. I've made over 11’ BTC with 2.1’ BTC retail trading, not on my own but with the help of a professional who has reputable background and understanding of the market, Kyle Miller, I came across his channel where he shares his charts. <The selling fatigue will wane, and the market will reset.

      "I< think the difference in this instance is that analysts are stating that we are heading for a DEPRESSION! so this changes everything in the grand scheme of things when talking about possible new ATHs. Great points in your video. I agree and suspect it may be too convenient to think BTC is perfectly correlated to S&P/Nasdaq and Altcoins to BTC. Refreshing to hear reasonable market analysis that takes a bigger picture perspective. So many people are squabbling over timing the exact bottom. That short-term thinking is such a rookie mistake. By dollar cost averaging and holding for several years, it takes the guesswork out. Next bull runs it won't be a huge deal if we bought at 21k or 17k. What will matter is that we are accumulating while the price is relatively low. I'm really holding on for this possible low point reentry, I screwed up some time back & I need this lower point to get back in, I’ve small cash on the sideline I don't like that but I refuse to FOMO in. Our younger investors are scared, they're concerned about what they should do because a lot of them have not been through this before. My advice to them is this, go all out into trading. Trading is where the bucks are been made. I see the stock market, housing values going down, and crypto going up. Traditional markets are getting recked. The new economy is crypto, not fiat. People want truth, not corruption, contracts not monetary easing. Venturing into crypto trading investment has been a turning point for me with the help and tutoring from my investment Advisor Mr.Kyle Miller.

      "Hi Casey, can i ask something please? Thank you for your great videos. I was thinking about stablecoins. Do traders convert BTC into a stablecoin when they feel the price is high and wait until the price drops down and \"buy back\" by converting back into BTC? is this what people do? also would convertions into different cryptos be classed as a selling it for tax purposes? thank you for any advice, all the best, Kieron\n",

Instead of being filled with angst and fear, they are showing a little courage and going ahead and stacking up their bags at a time when it makes a lot of sense to do so.  I think people need to stop being so fearful.  Now is the time to BUY.  That should be pretty clear by now.

      "< first got into BTC back in 2016 and have been hodling/buying assets at different price points since.  I've been through corrections before and will likely experience more over the future.  Volatility is simply the price one needs to pay if they want to play.  I don't have any Alts as I'm a bit of a BTC Maxi, but that said, if BTC hasn't died before, it surely won't do so now.  Stick in there - yes we are all feeling the pain, but over the long run this will just be a blip.  This is how I see past corrections when I felt that I got in at a high (back then I think it was less than $1000 and bouncing all over the place!).  Now when I look back, all I see is regret for not having the courage in buying more at those times. But if you believe BTC has value, then by all means, buy the dips if you can afford to.

      "Thanks<, for the update I always appreciate the insight. <I'm really blown away by the fact that having watched your videos for so long, I had the same opinion that you are putting forth in this video. <In as much I would like to add to what you have said here the market is in a tug of war with the bull at one side and the bears at the other end. If this is really a bear market rally then Bitcoin is not done going down, just like stocks are not done going down. And if this isn’t a bear market rally and the Fed achieves a soft landing, Bitcoin will probably rally substantially from where it is now, but we just have to wait and see.  My hope is that by the fourth quarter, the economy will be slowing enough that the Fed says we are going to pause, and then you will see the next crypto cycle start. I have witnessed the last 3 cycles and just before each bull run the amount of bear posts and negativity around crypto is just like it is now. Bitcoin is entering the area of where a bottom will be formed IMO. Please note this could take months and there will likely be further volatility in both directions.

The truth is that the market remains unpredictable especially in the long-term.

Could this outcome be a sign that the market is ready for a bigger recovery?

The good thing about the space is that you can buy the dips and put them into active trades making profits from trades while confidently waiting for a pump in price because it is inevitable. Most people do not understand how the space works. Your advantage is understanding, Charts won’t guarantee what an asset is going to do. Prices will go up or down.

Thank you for this amazing video, well done good sir!  Definitely gave me some ideas as far as new puzzles and potential mods. I appreciate the time you put into filming and production as well. No matter what anyone says that, just remember you’re DOING IT! If you feel unhappy with even the slightest things in a video, always remind yourself that you are doing something when other people aren’t. I’ve been watching your stuff for years and have always enjoyed these cube collection videos. Thank you again for your content!\n",

      "I really appreciate you covering the colorblind aspect. I have to have grey instead of green and black instead of orange on my cubes because of my color deficiency and it means significantly less choice in cubes. It's very frustraiting.\n",
      "It would actually be nice to have stickerless cubes reproducing the scheme of stickered cubes with black lines around the pieces. This is the reason why I prefer stickered cubes, the alternance between colors and black (kind of like shadows) make each piece stand out more and you get this really cool 3D aspect like you can really tell each piece is a small cube in itself, which with a stickerless cube is just not possible, it just seems like one big cube. Do you know what I mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: I guess what I wanted to say in a few words is that stickerless cubes visually have a lack of depth which I don’t really like.\n",
      "What I find good about stickerless is that you can be almost 100% sure that if you're buying a stickerless cube, it will turn at least half-decent, while on stickered you may run into unfilleted cubes that require wrist rotations, like the Original Rubik's series. Of course, you always look closely at what you're buying, but it just seems like an interesting little detail to think about. :)\n",
      "That's the first time I see someone talking about colorblind speedcubers. As a colorblind guy, I always had a stickered cube. Thank you for talking about this a little bit. Love your vids.\n",
      "I competed back when stickerless was illegal so I was thrilled when it was legalized. Just to find I enjoy stickered more. I like when the stickers get worn. It shows mileage on a cube which I think is cool\n",
      "For me, whether or not the cube is stickered actually matters a lot. I have always used a stickerless cube, and when I got a stickered cube, I noticed that I was a lot worse at look ahead - I made more mistakes in F2L and took longer to look.\n",
      "I have always used stickerless cubes, from when I learned all through now.  One day a friend and I swapped cubes to see how our times got affected by using each other cubes (I like my cubes fast, he likes them slower).  His main was a stickered cube.  Not only was I turning bad because the cube was slower then I was use to, but the stickers felt so WEIRD.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just cant use stickered cubes because of the edge on the sticker.\n",
      "I prefer stickered on 3x3, because I love the look. Any bigger cubes, the amount of stickers just makes it not worth it to me, to many that can get damaged, and replacing stickers gets exponentially more annoying. I would probably feel differently if the stickers from SpeedCubeShop weren't as good as they are, so I would still take a stickered 3x3 over a stickerless, given the option.\n",

It was really bad at maneuvering and would cause so much friction. So I decided to try and move it really fast back and forth and it literally blew into pieces in the middle of the parking lot and scattered everywhere mid-day with spectators around. Safe to say I could never get it back together. I ended up buying several speed cubes and I’m able to solve all of them.\n",

I solve many cubes, cuboids, odd shaped magic cubes, and supercubes and these often require the basic moves you teach here.  So while this is very beginner it is also very useful for advanced complex cubes that can't be solved with advanced algs,  A pleasure!!

      "J Perm once brought up that Rubik's brand doesn't really corner twist or pop. For non-speedcubers who wouldn't know how to fix those issues in a way that keeps the cube solvable, it's more important cube design makes these things impossible than it is important for cubes to be fast.\n",
      "I recently got myself the \"impossible cube\" that you showed at the end there. Regular Rubik's brand and it both popped and had stickers fall off right out of the box. I believe they either don't give a shit because they're still the largest or they're incompetent.\n",
      "I think its also built the way it is to prevent the cube from popping and corner twists.  You have to keep in mind its the OG cube meant for people that don't understand the puzzle and if anything like that were to happen then the puzzle is therefore \"broken\" to them\n",
      "I have a Rubik's cube that's almost 20 years old. I got into cubing recently and bought a MeiLong as soon as I got some disposable pennies. I always assumed that it turns this horrible at least in part because of its age. But seeing how your brand new cube turns exactly like mine now I wish I could get my hands on a new one just to see if there is any difference.\n",
      "My friends are going to a speed cubing comp next week so they wanted to get me into it too. Currently have a broken thumb and a rubiks brand cube. My best time is 3:45.56. I learned how to solve it 3 days ago and I’m currently dreaming of how fast I can get my time up to if I had a working cube and thumb :)\n",
      "I have only had a Rubik's cube for the entirety of my speed cubing journey. I'm finally going to get a good speed cube, but my best time on a regular cube is 40 seconds. It can be improved, I'm sure!\n",
      "The OG Rubik's Cube was set up to be basically \"temperamental child\" proof. Like you demonstrated, you can throw it at a wall and the wall will lose that battle - but it's also super unlikely to pop or corner-twist during normal use. Non-cubers often consider a cube \"broken\" if it's popped or corner-twisted - I remember having to rescue an expensive speedcube from the trash can because my cousin corner-twisted it.\n",
      "\n",
      "That comes at the expense of having almost no corner-cutting ability and having a lot of friction making it hard to turn., but then again it's not meant to be their Speedcube (the Rubik's brand speedcube is still kinda terrible though, but for different reasons).\n",
      "I have had a Rubix's cube for about 6 years now, and in all that time it has never popped. I am not much of a speedcuber but I average at around 40 seconds on that cube, and I know about 10 algorithms. It has got a couple of scratches but it still works like a charm. Now I am going more into speedcubing and i am considering buying a magnetic speedcube.\n",

Of course, when it comes to things like chess, this kind of thinking is completely erroneous, and on the contrary when one side \"wins\" both sides win - what is good for one aspect of chess is (broadly speaking) good for chess as a whole.  We should be doing everything possible to broaden chess's appeal, garner additional exposure and grow its global popularity, and online chess obviously plays an enormous role in that process.  What is good for online chess is also good for OTB chess.  FIDE (and other large bureaucratic institutions) will hopefully eventually recognize and embrace this too.\n",

That would explain both his laughter and generally humorous demeanor and amateur-like play.  This might be considered some innocent type of trolling or even an inside joke, but I suspect that if something akin or analogous to this had occurred in the NBA or NFL or MLB, some persons would be calling for an investigation.  Just looking for a hypothesis that would account for what occurred in game one of the Carlsen -Firouzja match.  (Note how strangely Carlsen played in game four, was it?, of his match with Pragg.)  I don't know how much Las Vegas type betting goes on with respect to the world of chess, but a game like this could make someone who put money on the game very unhappy.  In some ways, it was embarrassing to watch.  I don't believe that type of behavior advanced the cause of pro chess.\n",

      "That’s how you shouldn’t behave in a chess game. Black just plays intolerant and aggressively touches on the clock. I hate that\n",

      "What chemistry among these commentators, what learning and fun for us lower-rated amateurs!  Congrats, David, on your Olympiad medal!  Way to show the flag of England.  Hope you can still do commentary now and then if you join the chess tour and, if you join,  may your skills take you to 2800.  God Bless.\n",
      "Congratulations again to David Howell! 🙂👍\n",
      "David deserves a gold metal for his commentary as well\n",
      "Anish Giri does love studying chess theory so the prospect that he might still be in opening preparation in game 2 (1:44:12) does not surprise me that much\n",
      "I followed the Olympiad and was floored by David's performance.  There were over 180 teams, each with around 5 players,  so there must have been  800-900 (if not more) players in the Open division.  Not one of them played more successfully than David Howell.  Moreover, his efforts went a long way towards giving England a top 15 finish.   Congratulations David Howell.  I was very happy for you.\n",
      "Would love to see Judit Polgar & David Howell commenting. That would be great!\n",

      "18:37 the amount of times Eric has made this joke and explained that he didn't actually say it just makes it all the more funny haha\n",
      "Was following the game live online, curious to see how your QGD panned out. I couldn't work out why the clocks weren't moving and the last few moves were missing - this explains it, thanks.\n",
      "That would have been an epic otb stalemate! I’d love to see an engine analysis at the end of these to see any missed opportunities or where you went wrong\n",
      "Eric love your stalemate attempt, hope your opponent could see the fun of it lol\n",
      "Thank you for another enjoyable recap. You seem moderately exhausted and mildly disheartened, but the fact of the matter is you kept it close against an experienced ~2600 GM. That bodes well for the future if you decide to make a harder push for GM at some point. Good luck in your remaining rounds!\n",
      "I got a stalemate trap over the board once. It was against a 1700 rated player and he was living on a +30 increment, it was a little more elaborate than your one, I had to sacrifice the queen but he had no way to stop it, and I got so excited I lost the ability to speak   for the next 30 min and I was just thinking about you all the time, so thank you for that 1/2 point, Eric\n",

      "I have been a beginner for 30 yrs. I am professional beginner. Beginner Master. Expert in finding win for my opponent\n",
      "Believe it or not I’m getting a bit emotional watching this. I was fascinated by chess as a kid, but I was useless at it and got discouraged. My dad tried to teach me, but that mostly involved a lot of yelling, swearing, and tears. This is the first time I’ve seen someone explain the game with such clarity, enthusiasm, patience, and obvious love for the game. At 32, hopefully this is the beginning of a new chess journey for me. Thankyou so much.\n",
      "Finally a video that has explained the concept of chess PROPERLY for beginners. I have tried to learn for years and could not find anyone who had the ability to explain this to me. Thank you so much GothamChess 🌞\n",

      "You have an awesome way of keeping a total newbie engaged and not feeling totally lost! Thank you! Looking forward to getting started.\n",
      "Very helpful! I learned how the pieces moved decades ago as a kid, but I never learned concepts like piece vision, protecting pieces, tactics vs strategies, etc. I taught myself a bit of these through playing, but I have many holes in my understanding.\n",
      "I have huge anxiety, Starting to play with other people, started off marking huge mistakes, but I'm making fewer mistakes and learning what to do instead of what I did start off,  really improved !\n",
      "I’ve always loved chess even since I was a kid but I always found it too hard to remember the moves and rules when I was younger but being older now I’ve rediscovered how much I love it and this video really helped me get back into the swing of things and was also really informative, I’ve subscribed and I’ll be checking out your other videos to help me along the way\n",

      "Wow Peter really had tears for pragg after the heartbreak of a game for him @4:55:00 ! Amazing how chess players can feel each other's  pain ♥️..And everyone does like Pragg..\n",
      "Great to see Lawrence back, and he seems new and improved.  Well maybe not new, but improved.\n",
      "Peter Leko is a very sweet guy in the way he speaks 👍\n",
      "I just don't think Magnus takes chess very seriously anymore.  And that's his right.  We're still thrilled to have him, distracted.  Still very entertaining and insightful, still a great contributor to the chess world.\n",
      "Peter Leko ❤️.  4:54:58 😥....Pragyanantha good effort man 👍\n",
      "Magzy unstoppable\n",
      "Lawrence Trent reminds me of Peter O’Hanrahahanrahan. Leko is trying to analyze and he’s rambling about other stuff\n",
      "Would it be possible to make sure that the player's board + eval bar is never removed from the screen? There's a lot of times where we're showing the analysis board, and the 4 faces of the players/commentators, and that's terrible for me because I can't see what's happening in the real game, what the current eval is, and do my own thoughts. Plus there's really no need to see all 4 faces and not see the board\n",
      "Honestly I appreciate you and your content < Technical Analysis is good but I find It truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure T.A and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumps/pumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems. It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps,narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 12 btc from day tradng with *WTRADE INSPECTS* insights and charts. They been one step ahead of other analysis..\n",
      "Ccrypto is off helping to regulate<, rather than pretend it won't ever happen.  The big institutions getting in is the catalyst that will launch us into  the stratosphere.  Most people don't like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize. And benefits they were unaware with before turn out to be far more beneficial.  Few if any rug pulls.  The projects that initiated the process of regulation have not been ruined, they got involved in setting guidelines and helping the regulators understand the crypto space. I’d get involved more knowing that I have made over 16` btc from day-trade with *WTRADE INSPECTS* in few weeks.\n",
      "That's why Magnus really wanted to face a new generation player in the WCC since he knew they had more chances than the players of his generation. It's just like other tournaments, even if Magnus loses some games, he still won the tournament. Looking forward to Praggnanandha, an amazing performance for him.\n",
      "Thank you for your videos mate.<The BTC shows us that when he wakes up he knows how to do it and destroy all the bears!! Never go against the trends on cryptos, even less put levers, it is about the immediate sanction as soon as you turn your back, now anyone who has been in the crypto space for the last 6 or more years certainly knows about the cycle structure, every 4 yearsBTC goes through a halving even where the amount of Bitcoin that is mined is cut half. Well, the block reward is cut in half. this cause huge price spikes every 4 yrs because it create a supply and demand crisis that can't be priced in until it's a reality. >but all thanks to *WTRADE INSPECTS* who taught me how to make trade and increased my Crypto from 2.5 to 10BTC now. No one really knows what is going to happen in the market and I know you are only saying what you think will happen based on the past. It is yours and my opinion so people should make their own Investment choices based on their own research. ......\n",
      "Magnus Carlsen is THE GOAT! Congrats to Pragg...i'm sure he will be the new world champion\n",
      "So happy for Pragg!!! 😀😀😀 I was thinking \"push your pawns Pragg at the end game, please push your pawns!\" And when he finally started doing that he had much better winning chances. Well done!\n",
      "Pragg continuing to be the comeback king!! Amazing play, he made this tournament extremely exciting, was just glued to all his games. And Magnus also played really well at the start but I lost respect for him towards the end when in the interviews he just kept making excuses for his defeats and tried to discredit pragg completely. He couldn't even look at pragg for even a second as he was speaking and looked so disinterested. The least you could do even if u dont congratulate him or admit he played well is acknowledge him and he couldnt even do that which is a shame because Magnus has carried himself so well in the past and praised pragg before so it's not that he cant but simply he couldnt accept the defeats today which is so disappointing from a professional player like him, rlly left a bitter taste but I'm soo happy for pragg that even if he didnt win the tournament, he certainly showed hes a force to be reckoned with and won our hearts with his persistence which was just so inspiring.\n",
      "Firouzja and Pragganandhaa are both playing very well at this age, the future is in the hands of these two young men. But I can't say which one\n",
      "Pragg; I was lucky today to win the 4th game.\n",
      "Magnus: I did not have good sleep yesterday. \n",
      "Lol\n",

      "Aronian has such a great attitude towards the game of chess.\n",
      "Such a gentleman.\n",
      "Levon Aronian is by far my favourite player - excellent att chess of course, but a really nice and likeable person too.\n",
      "I wish you guys would cover more than just one game per round! switch around and explore several games!\n",
      "Hans interview is even funnier because he's not even 21. It's literally illegal for him in Miami to hit the mini bar!\n",
      "It looked like Aronian was just exhausted in Game 4 and wanted to be done with it, else those last moves with so much time don't make much sense for a player of his quality.\n",
      "Chess didn't speak... It was Screaming in Pragg v/s Lev !!!\n",
      "chess needs more funding ,, seriously ,, the best of the minds are fighting it out ,, there should be more prize money for each of them ,,\n",
      "Pragg🔥🔥\n",
      "03:09:15 you came for this interview.\n",
      "Now that Pragg has beaten Levon Aronian   who would Pragg be playing in day 5 ?\n",
      "Pragg is amazing player..even aronian smile when he lost to pragg and magnus also smile when he lost that final game to pragg..it is show that you are great player if opponent smile when they lost to you\n",
      "Leko is just the best asset of chess24 :D what a machine\n",
      "Pragg the mountain GOAT! The world is awakening to Tamil's mental prowness. Equal to the best and 2,nd to none. Let the chess speak for itself .You ain't seen nothing yet !!!\n",
      "Winning a high level tournament while chilling and enjoying a comedy podcast, magnus seems to have found the right combination of work+chill.\n",
      "Magnus the 🐐 wins another event. The man just can’t stop winning one event after another!!\n",
      "Great event!\n",
      "Magnus looked little disinterested, he may have thought he was winning anyway\n",
      "You can’t rlly blame him he missed a mate in 4 with 10 seconds left\n",
      "MAGNUS is the biggest heart of chess player. He delibrately lost himself at the final. He won the tournament and won everything. Actually the true winner is someone who gives the winning to those who more needed. Magnus did and always does. TAKING KNIGHT E6, ARE YOU KIDDING?.\n",
      "bring wesley back and give a shot to raunak! better than pragg. the next vishy!\n",
      "And magnus introduced the new laughing gambit....but tbh magnus such a beast even he blunders somewhere he'll find all good moves after and manages to hold....prag too well played n not pushed too much....GG❤️\n",

      "I LOVE ANTONIO'S \"PHILOSOPHY\" MOMENTS, LIKE THIS ONE ABOUT THE \"TIME STEMP PEOPLE\", WHO WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT HE HAS SAID!\n",
      "WOAH! So many double takes throughout this match. Every time I glanced away, Magnus slipped out of another hairy situation. Magnus is a magician 🪄 🎩\n",
      "King's Indian Defense, Carlsen is cheeky. The Chess King is defending vs an Indian\n",
      "The main reason I like Alex is because she is genuinely interested in people and pays attention to them when they speak, tell stories, etc. Very rare nowadays IMO.\n",
      "Trash Talker snatched defeat from the jaws of victory...\n",
      "He didn't miss the move, just wanted to keep the game going.\n",
      "What a turnaround!  Plus: this was a particularly good video because she sort of interviewed him about his life's experience with chess!  So it's a trash talk game....with an interview!  Alex is juggling three things during this video!  Liked the written commentary tips as well.\n",
      "Man he messed that one up so, so bad. Had a free rook and totally threw his advantage right in the eternal bowels of fire hell.\n",
      "Love how you tell him he is not hitting the clock right, could waste your time while he is making a move, and he won’t change, so you start hitting the clock twice two. Too funny.\n",
      "\"I was born as an orphan\", lost me right at the start 😆\n",
      "After that moment when he started talking shit into the camera he fell apart lol. Classic overconfidence right there.\n",
      "Amazing comeback! I really tought that taking the rook still will give him a win but in the end  that didnt help and wow really nice to see that you didnt collapse to time pressure, that's for sure inspiring Great Gaming from both :D\n",

      "That \"fake training\" tip has given me an epiphany about everything I do in life. Thank you Levy.\n",
      "I started at 255 in April and I played so badly that my friends made me a laughing stock whenever I play together with them. I decided to subscribe to your channel, put some effort to study openings (I pick solely London for white and either KID or Scandi for black), and in 2 months I went up to 500. I stagnated between 600-700 until August, so I decided to learn more from you, consequently I start winning and 0-blunder games started to be a habit around November. In December I reached 900 and after now I am finally at the 4-digit mark. Thank you Levy! You're such a great teacher!\n",
      "\"Local sight\" is a common mistake (at least for me at fast time controls). You focus your attention on a specific area of the board and just forget that (far beyond) a long range piece is defending a square you judge unprotected.\n",

      "\n",
      "Lesson learned: Every step you take, Levy is watching you.\n",
      "Dude the fake training tip really does apply to everything. I’ve been practicing life drawing every day but just mindlessly putting marks on paper without internalizing new concepts. No wonder why I haven’t improved in quite a while. Thanks for opening my eyes Gotham!\n",
      "I’ve started late in life at 58, and I’ve been paying for a year now. I decided to get better after I got so angry during lock down playing with my husband, that I felt sooo silly. Then Watching your videos, over and over made a big difference and In the last couple of months I’ve had some pretty amazing breakthrough! So thank you!\n",
      "This was more than a chess lesson.  This was a life lesson.  Thank you, Levy!\n",
      "This video is EXACTLY what the doctor ordered for me. I am guilty of ALL of these. I'm overly \"fake trained\" on puzzles, with an overconfidence and overinflated (2000-2100) puzzle rating. But in online games, I'm getting my ass handed to me by 1200 players, because of ALL these mistakes!!! Time to do a major reset! I made a post it cheat sheet on these 7 mistakes and will keep it in front of me as I play future online games. Time to get back to completing all the opening courses I have on Chessable!

You may not be (at this time) the number one chess player in the world, but I think you're doing something far more important: you're winning the hearts of these children and that is a gift that will stay with them for life.

The great thing about him is that he became an International Master without even being a professional chess player. He worked in a bank, and in his free time or vacations he played tournaments. Regarding this game, he mentioned that he just enjoyed every move that Fischer made on the board (Letelier played 3 times against Fischer, being defeated 2 times, and beating Bobby 1 time). \n",

      "Jerry, your videos are some of the most instructive on the internet. My top 3 favorite Youtubers are you, Gotham and Daniel Naroditsky. Gotham teaches you how to understand broad, overarching concepts like a master. Daniel teaches you how to understand the fine details like a master. And you teach us how to realize what master-level thinking even looks like. Seriously. I studied tactics and positional chess for years and couldn't advance past 1200. But your Beginner to GM series totally revolutionized the way I looked at the board. I gained more in the 2 years since I watched those videos than I did in my previous 5+ years of serious chess study.\n",

Maybe a digital clock that can be synchronized to the video?  2) If you or opponent resign, a 30 second explanation of why it was \"resigns\" at the end would be awesome.  In this case, I saw your B on a5 was hanging and white's rook defending their e2 bishop.  But it's not always super easy for us to figure out.\n",
      "Anna took two losses in a row and was laughing and having fun with a strong player. It's amazing to watch two pros go neck and neck at each other like this. Thank you so much!\n",
      "Other than an amazing player, Danny seems really modest and kind. I wish I was living anywhere near these kinds of Parks. I love how it's nice weather, people casually walking by and stop to spectate the game. It kind of restores my faith in this world\n",

In an esport I follow, (Age of Empires 2) one player (TheViper) was so dominant for so long that a streamer (T90Official) came up with the idea of an event he called Hidden Cup where everyone's identities were hidden and only revealed at the end. Each player was given a name to play under so nobody knew who was who. Was a really interesting concept, as there were awesome games and so much speculation over who was who. They've repeated the format 4 times now, which says something about how loved it is. But with chess being an online thing now, this kind of event is very possible and I think would be fascinating.

      "My grandfather actually played with Bobby regularly in 1956 at the West Orange Chess Club in New Jersey. They played on the same team in inter-state tournaments. I found some of my Grandpa’s old letters and it’s pretty cool. He won multiple chess championships (some amateur and some professional) in the late 40s and early 50s. He also was involved in a few professional chess clubs and magazines. He was born in 1909 and while I like to think he taught Bobby a thing or two to help him gain his immense success that year, it’s likely the 13 year old schooled my grandpa. My grandpa quit chess in 1957 to turn professional in bridge because it was better financially (chess tournaments didn’t pay well back then). Though, he probably played teenage Bobby enough to know he stood no chance in the future. If a 13 year old made a multi-time champion quit the game entirely, he must have been truly special. My grandpa could card count so I don’t think he had a problem switching to bridge, and became a national life master in bridge and had a successful career. I never got to meet him because he died before I was born (I’m only 23), I would’ve loved to ask him about Bobby. Maybe my mom knows a bit more. All I have are letters and a few chess trophies.

Fishers mental health was probably not caused by chess but the pressure that came to surround him due to his success at chess. While playing he probably felt safe, knowing the rules, knowing everyone had to obey them and that he would not be mocked for some social faux pas he didn't understand or care about.\n",

      "When it comes to Apple the key to the hints they give is not to overthink it and I’m pretty sure this is related to the newer bigger camera that’s gonna be on the phones that will take beautiful pictures of the night sky. If there’s one thing I’ve learned about Apple in the past 10 years is that they aren’t that deep.\n",
      "It’s going to be sooo awesome this year and I can’t wait for all the fun we’re gonna have in the livestream! 😃\n",

      "I am very excited! I do believe it is focused on iPhone and Apple Watch along with maybe some new AirPod Pro models. The iPad release along with a new Mac pro computer will come in October. It will be strange getting iOS watchOS and tvOS updates but no iPad out West on the same day. It is called confusion. Apple needs to work on consistency and not just jumping around like they decided to do if that is what will happen. I’d like Apple because of their consistency and being able to keep things in the same time frame. Hopefully I was 16 and watchOS along with tvOS will be released on Monday, September 12 which is a scheduled day off for me from work. I do not like getting updates while I am at work because it will take time to install them. I did watch YouTube video from a different channel and I replied to the comments about compatibility for next year and he thought that iPhone 8 would not be compatible with iOS 17 in 2023. Do you think this is true? If so, should my parents who have iPhone 8 models should upgrade this year or wait until before I was 17 comes out? Out? I did tell them about the iPhone SE third-generation because neither one seems interested in upgrading to my iPhone 12 or getting one with face ID themselves.\n",
      "Seems odd to create AR creative around satellite tech, since it’s just for emergencies.  But also agree doesn’t seem like cameras will get tech for astro photography as you’d think other issues with phone photography need to be addressed before trying to shoot stars. In any case, glad they put out the invites a week earlier than usual — I’ll be able to plan for Get Ready/Pre-Order/APU if all models are on-time.\n",
      "I usually switch back and forth yearly between apple and android as I like both (fanboy of neither) but apple is hitting a peak and really not innovating much anymore. I’m just going to switch from the 13 pro max to the S22 Ultra. As I said I love both but I’m not seeing any reasons to upgrade with apple this year. If the 15 is a game changer it will be right up my yearly cycle routine switch between both 👌🏻\n",

      "Here’s an 💡:\n",
      "\n",

      "I truly appreciate your videos. Because of you, I’ve kept my XsMax and my Apple Watch 5. I don’t see the need to upgrade until next year if Apple go to the USBC.\n",
      "Good news with keeping the stem. I always wondered how they could pull a stem removal off without killing usability. I mean how the hell should you press a button when this thing is turning 180° and then buttons are on the inside.\n",
      "iPhone 14 will be the most amazing incredible outrageous thing anyone has seen anywhere in all of time and even beyond time\n",
      "It will run IOS 15, come in many colors, take great photos and videos, will be able to charge on a little black plate on a table, extreme perfect infinite edit whenever and always multitask, exquisitely play very special music and movies, and like the last 3 generations will be enable you to multi task at lightning speed but perhaps a little faster but you will not be able to notice since the last one was so fast \n",
      "It will be pure magic 🪄\n",
      "I am ready for September 7! Hopefully iOS 16 and watchOS now will come out on Monday the 12th. That would be a good release date. I find it funny that iPadOS will be delayed a month. That is very strange. It seems like Apple would just wait until stage manager got fixed and release it with a subsequent update like iPadOS 16.1 or 16.0.1.\n",
      "Was really hoping the airpods would have some sort of hearing loss/hearing aid abilities. There is a stigma (and $$$$ pricing on real hearing aids) whereas most \"headphones & phone\" combos have far more processing and programming abilities to the nerfed offerings from hearing aid manufacturers. It would be a massive market to tap into and takeover for whichever phone maker does it first.\n",
      "On the beta ios 16 there is a battery indicator feature in battery settings it is automatically set so default to only show in low power mode instead of the bar decreasing it will always show you your battery 👍\n",
      "Tolles Video. 💪\n",
      "Schade das sie die Notch nicht lassen bis sie komplett unter dem Display verschwindet.\n",
      "Ist doch eigentlich das Erkennungszeichen vom iPhone.\n",
      "Ich glaube das sie das iPhone Mini alle paar Jahre, wieder aktualisiert, bringen werden.\n",
      "Da ich erst letztes Jahr beim 13pro Max zugeschlagen habe wird es dieses Jahr wohl ein Update von meinem 2017er iPad Pro 10.5 werden.\n",
      "Mal schauen was im Oktober kommt. \n",
      "Gruß an alle ✌️🙏\n",
      "Mein Standpunkt, jedes Produkt ohne USB-C wird nicht gekauft. Beispielsweise hätte ich gerne Kopfhörer, die AirPods Pro sollen es werden, das Geld liegt bereit. Durch den Lightning-Anschluss wären sie schon vor dem Kauf veraltet und ein Fehlkauf. Das gleiche gilt auch für die iPhones. Das Ende anderer Anschlüsse ist durch die EU eingeleitet und steht fest.\n",
      "Das Highlight, (wenn es denn überhaupt kommt) dürfte die Apple Watch Pro werden (vor allem beim  Preis 😂🙈) oder die normale Apple Watch im kantigen Design. Das neue iPhone (ob nun groß oder klein) wirkt für mich persönlich, recht unspektakulär (Recycling IPhone Pro aus dem Vorjahr), gleiches gilt für die iPhone Pro-Modelle.  Ob nun Pille oder Notch ? Selbst wenn die Kamera jetzt noch „unbelievable“ wäre, würde mir das keine 1200 Euro, aus der Geldbörse locken. Ich denke, es wird auch das letzte iPhone, mit einem A-Chip überhaupt sein. Nächstes Jahr wird auch das iPhone auf den M-Chip umgestellt. Meiner Meinung nach, längst überfällig. Ich rechne noch fest mit neuen AirPods oder AirPods Pro. Interessant dürfte sein, was mit dem Apple TV passiert ? Auch mit der Überarbeitung des HomePod Mini rechne ich fest. Von einem neuen, alten „HomePod“, gehe ich derzeit nicht aus. Mich persönlich interessiert nur die neue Watch, da bei meine 4er, langsam der Akku schlapp macht und Apple nächstes Jahr, bei dem 4er Modell, den Software-Hahn endgültig zudrehen wird. Das wird vielen so gehen, da viele noch das 4er Modell haben und schon seit einem Jahr auf das kantige Design warten. Aber eins steht für mich auch ganz klar fest: Kein kantiges Design, keine neue Apple Watch ! Dann muss die 4er, bei mir noch ein Jahr, irgendwie weiter überleben. 🤷🏻‍♂️\n",
      "Vielleicht bekommt ja der Lightning Anschluss der Iphones ein \"Speed Update\" auf USB 3(.x). Das hatten sie auch im letzten Ipad Pro verbaut (allerdings damals ein langsamer USB 3 Chip der nur rund die doppelte USB 2 Geschwindigkeit konnte).  Also Technisch wäre es ja machbar wenn sie wollten. Dann wären auch die großen Videos schneller am PC/Mac\n",
      "Die Apple Watch 8 wird vermutlich meine erste Apple Watch werden. Bin mal gespannt.\n",
      "Ich freue mich natürlich auf den Event und bin wie immer gespannt. Was ich aber mit meinem iPhone mache, weiß ich noch nicht. Ich bin mit dem 12'er noch immer vollkommen zufrieden und habe über die vielen vorangegangenen Versionen und Käufe gelernt, dass ich eigentlich mit dem neuen iPhone meist genau dasselbe mache, wie mit dem vorherigen. Eigentlich sollte ich das 12Pro erst ersetzen, wenn es entweder kaputt geht oder der Akku am Ende seines Lebens ist, beides trifft nicht zu. Vermutlich staune ich über das neue iPhone und vielleicht bin ich neidisch auf schöne neue Farben, aber dann nehme ich meins aus der Hülle und stelle fest, dass mein Oceam Blue auch nicht so übel ist. 😉 Zusammengefasst verspüre ich keinen Wunsch oder gar Drang, ein neues iPhone anzuschaffen und bin mit meinem Happy. Vermutlich überspringe ich das 14'er auch noch, um dann beim 15er zuzuschlagen.\n",
      "Ich werde bestimmt nicht \"dabei\" sein – und ich hätte auch überhaupt nichts dagegen, wenn Apple nur alle 3 Jahre oder so mal ein neues Modell herausbringt. Wer braucht alle diese marginalen Verbesserungen? Mein altes SE ist immer noch ein sehr gutes Telefon, verwaltet Termine und Nachrichten prima und unterstützt die Organisation meines Business' ganz hervorragend.\n",
      "Ich bin noch unentschlossen, entweder das iPhone 14 Max oder das Pro Max, werde die Keynote abwarten 📱😎🖖\n",

      "Dieses Mal hat wohl der Feiertag am Montag ein Event am Dienstag verhindert. \n",
      "Mal schauen, ob eine neue AppleWatch vorgestellt wird, die meine Series 1 ersetzen könnte. \n",
      "Das iPhone interessiert mich in diesem Jahr überhaupt nicht. Wenn, dann würde ich nur ein iPhone 14 mini in Erwägung ziehen. Ob es eines geben wird — man weiß es nicht! Lassen wir uns durch die eklige Gerüchteküche nicht in die Irre führen.\n",
      "Denn was ich überhaupt nicht ab kann ist, wenn sich selbst ernannte „Experten“ darüber aufregen, dass sich Apple-Geräte verspäten, die überhaupt nicht nicht angekündigt wurden! 🙄\n",
      "LG Claus,\n",
      "Mich interessiert diese mal vor allem das technische Innere der iPhones. Beim MacBook Air M2 hat Apple beim kleinsten Speicher lediglich einen einzelnen Baustein verbaut und die Geräte sind deshalb angeblich langsam. Falls diese Technik auch bei den iPhones verbaut wird bin ich schon gespannt was drinnen ist.\n",
      "Und zum iPhone Mini:\n",

      "I know I’m in the minority, but I love my 13 Mini, will be keeping that until it can’t go anymore, or some huge leap in tech comes. Also, got a titanium Apple Watch 7 at launch and will be keeping that until we get a HUGE leap in battery tech.\n",
      "I have an iPhone 11 pro that I'm completely happy with.  I'm STILL impressed by the cameras on it... beautiful pictures and video.  Is there ANY compelling reason for me to upgrade to the 14?  Otherwise I'll wait until the 15 with USB-C.\n",
      "I'll upgrade when they finally put USB-C on next year's iPhone.\n",
      "I feel like getting rid of the mini was a stupid decision on there part. I feel a redesigned little bit bigger 14 mini would do really well. \n",
      "I also see no reason for anyone to upgrade. I upgraded from a 12 mini to a regular 13 when I switched carriers. I can personally say the phones are nearly Identical in every way. If thats any indication of what to expect from the 14 line, I would say if you have an 11pro, any 12, or 13 model theres not much of a reason to upgrade. IOS 16 isnt a design overhaul anything. Ill be keeping my iphone 13 for a long time. \n",
      "The watch saying not to buy one is kinda dumb. If you can find a series 6 or 7 buy it especially when you can get a series 7 for around $280-$340 brand or refurbished from apple. Instead of getting the new SE which is essentially a series 6. \n",
      "I think upgrading the watch or Iphone this year is already a skip.\n",
      "The product to be most excited for is the 10th gen ipad. Getting way better features. I will def be upgrading my mini 5 to and ipad 10th gen especially since it’ll have usb-c. I wish they would do the same with the iphone, airpods & apple pencil. \n",
      "I cant wait for the October event. I think if you have an apple watch SE,5,6,7 you dont need to upgrade your watch either.\n",
      "Whoever's reading this, i pray that whatever you're going through gets better and whatever you're struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen\n",
      "Apple is making a big mistake by giving the Apple Watch Pro all the nice features. We’ve been waiting for a redesign for the Apple Watch for awhile. But Apple will just have to deal with the consequences and watch as all this Pro watches sit on shelves and collect dust, just like the original HomePod\n",
      "hearing about the pro models getting more expensive and the regular ones being barely an upgrade i just hope the 13 mini will get the usual 100€ price drop\n",
      "They should also have a mid tier Mac mini like in between the Mac Studio and m2 mac mini. It should have a m2 pro and m2 max as options.\n",

      "My main problem with the M2 Air is that it sits between the M1 air and the 14\" MacBook pro. Those are two of the best laptops ever made. If you can find the M1 Air on sale, then it is still an outstanding value. If you are paying to upgrade the SSD and RAM, then the M2 Air is so close in price to the 14\" MacBook pro that if you can spend the little bit extra, you will not regret doing so.\n",
      "Been using my M2 MBA for 2 weeks now, the best decision I ever made. Totally loving the starlight. It's fast, very light and the battery is definitely powerful; I only gotta charge it after 2 days of heavy usage at work.\n",
      "This should be an interesting video. I’m also going to be very curious how this machine fares against upcoming MBP M2 models.\n",
      "I love it to have the options for the slower Flash Storage and RAM with more capacities. I am ready to live with the consequences of slow swap files. But if the MacBook has enough RAM swapping things shouldn't be the issue.\n",
      "Ended up buying the M1 with upgraded memory and student discount, costed me around $970. It is a fantastic machine,.M2 not worth it imo as a college student when M1 can do all the tasks I want effortlessly\n",
      "One of the best reviews I've seen for the M2 Air. Very grounded and realistic.\n",
      "The base model is definitely not future proof with apps and services getting hungrier, but an upgraded M2 (16/512) would be a delightful machine to work on for several years\n",
      "It would have been cool if they had incorporated what the last intel 16” model had where you can change the refresh rate up to 60hz; not great, but I would assume that would help with battery having lower refresh rate than the standard if you’re viewing movies. It sucks that Apple has made that limitation, but is that a limitation on the Thunderbolt or SoC 🤔? I feel that the argument that many people don’t use a dual monitor setup is not really true, especially in the work place. My sister uses dual monitors working from home, and she uses one of those mini-work towers. The thing that tempts me the most about the Air, is the weight, portability, and the amount of power (given specific specs), it’s more or less well-rounded. However, if I’m bumping up the storage and unified memory, I wouldn’t be that far off from the M1 Pro 14” MacBook Pro price. Strangely, the 14” would be lighter than my current and very outdated 2012 13” non-retina MacBook Pro 😅. The only cool thing about that model is the upgradability, but even that is a novelty that’s losing it’s veneer over the years given the limited options to upgrade to. I’m hanging onto it as my backup computer. Really ought to start saving for a more up-to-date laptop. The smudging thing is annoying from what I see. It’s an awesome color, but having to clean it that often is not enticing to me at all. Besides the size, portability and power, not having a loud fan spinning in there is another thing that I’ve yet to experience. At work, I work with desktop towers and I’m used to the noise, I suppose.\n",
      "Thanks for helping me justify that I should get the MBP 14\" instead of the M2 MBA.\n",
      "As a student looking for a portable workspace this is perfect for me. I already have a supped up gaming pc so yeah. Shame about the lack of dual display, really was a bit of a bummer. I went for 16gb/512 in silver, cant wait :D\n",
      "Glad I went with the M1 MBA last year instead of waiting. \n",
      "I like the look better than the wedge but honestly the M1 is the best laptop I've ever had. \n",
      "If I could do one thing different I'd upgrade the RAM but I still don't think I'm gonna push it too hard. 🤷🏻‍♂️\n",
      "Guys we were right. They removed the box too\n",
      "I’m kinda glad the iPhone 14 is still the same as 12 and 13, gives me a reason to keep my money and my iPhone 12 Pro Max ✌🏼😁\n",
      "I’m usually at least somewhat excited in my anticipation of the redesigned iPhone models. But to be honest, the Pacific Blue of 12 Pro Max has me very content, and it will take another completely revolutionary design/software leap for me to leave this device. Pacific Blue is just too pretty to let go of.\n",
      "Thanks for the inside look into the iPhone 14 Pro Max. I kind of figured that the hardware would be similar to the 13 Pro Max. Hope Apple steps it up with always on display and maybe reverse wireless charging. No point in adding a bigger battery if they won’t unleash all the capabilities.\n",

      "That pretty much solves my problem. Gonna buy the latest 13 pro. The green color is gorgeous.\n",
      "I love how Lou was literally more excited about the Caliper than the phone. Humorous!\n",
      "I work with Mitutoyo calipers every day. It's supposedly more accurate if you measure towards the inside of the jaws due to the outside being more susceptible to bend due of lever forces or whatever it's called. But likely doesn't matter if not measuring to micron (0.001mm) levels.\n",
      "I’m planning on getting the 13 pro max cuz my XR has run its course I assumed the 14 wouldn’t be any different and I was right but the only thing that would kinda make me want to get it is the supposed new orange color, orange is my favorite color 🍊🧡\n",
      "~0,66 mm larger lenses on iPhone 14 will be a HUGE difference on such small optics!! That will render much faster speeds and maybe even make room for bigger image sensors or better stabilisation.\n",
      "I think Apple needs to re-think their pricing. I’m a huge Apple fan, but the prices for their products are now just getting rediculous.\n",
      "I’m very excited for the future of Apple, but as you said, the downside is that there are too many products and if Apple doesn’t start to focus on their lineup they will just become another tech company lacking what makes Apple products so iconic and better\n",
      "i wish apple tried something new that samsung did with the galaxy series and that was creating an \"active\" rugged phone from the ground up no need for  a case, it was a phone that was built to withstand drops and not get dinged up or have glass chipped. it offered great grips on the side and i think apple could really hit a good target audience with something like that\n",
      "The biggest change Apple needs to make is to deal with their ethics issues.  That means no longer lying to their customers, not abusing them, not wallet r@ping them for profit, not gaslighting them,  being honest about how private Apple products *REALLY* are, not using decieving marketing, etc.  That way, they might start to get back some of their credibility back. At this stage they have a *HUGE* problem on their hands, as they are rapidly gaining a reputation for being one of the most unethical and dishonset companies around.\n",
      "I am very excited to see what happens now that Johnny has moved on to something else. It took some getting used to but I really like watchOS along with iOS and iPadOS. Sometimes I think Apple keeps a certain product like the iPhone X or Apple Watch Series 3 supported way too long. One thing that forces you to get a new Apple Watch is when the battery starts malfunctioning. That has happened to me twice. I have the same Apple TV that you were talking about that needs to be discontinued. I have not had any issues with it so I have no reason to complain except I do believe they need a new high definition Apple TV. My TV does not support 4K. When Apple stops supporting this particular TV model, I will definitely upgrade. Although my new TV has AppleTV built into the App Store, I cannot find the ESPN or MLB applications and I have not found a Visio App Store.\n",
      "The Apple we have now is much larger than the Apple Steve inherited after they nearly died. I don’t think they have too many products but I agree about them dragging along some models like the watch and TV HD. Apple’s current path is bringing new customers to the Mac that would have stayed on Windows. Simple functionality can mean having the ports a laptop needs and great battery life.\n",
      "Apple need to come stronger this year with the new design and advanced iPhone 14 line up\n",
      "I love my Apple phone I just wish that it was more customizable! Also a big issue I have with Apple is they make you pay for storage I think they should just offer it to their customers instead of making them pay monthly for it it’s ridiculous I refused to pay for memory from them I would pay google first\n",
      "Hey Robert, I've used Apple products since the 80's, owned since the 90's  I love apple products, but they have left me in a position I never thought I'd be in with them.  My late 2015, 27\" iMac is one of the models to get cut off from macos 13.  That's not a big deal.  What bothers me more is there is no 27\" iMac  with Apple Silicon.  It's been the perfect combination of space saving, and nice big beautiful display.  There current line up is just something I'm not sure what I want.  Mac Mini, or, Mac studio + Apple Pro display may end up costing more than the iMac did to get something equivalent \n",
      "\n",
      "I have two years left of security updates for Monterey, which is good.  I'd rather have an older computer that runs well, and meets my needs, than buy something new that I wouldn't enjoy using.\n",
      "On that note, my AppleTV (s) and iPhone will get the next updates, so will be able to look forward to that.\n",
      "I am very excited to see what is coming next for Apple. I just bought the new macbook air M2 chip and am in love with the sleek thin design with the biggest and brightest screen that Apple has ever had.\n",
      "I updated mine too! So tired of lazy, wicked human beings that enjoy taking advantage of everyone specially the elderly so many scammers and hackers from Foreign and domestic!\n",
      "Pretty much 90% of all apple devices now are vulnerable\n",
      "Funny how there's a new hack discovered everytime Apple is within days of revealing a new phone huh?!\n",
      "nothing new -- this had been the case for so man years. We have seen many time when Microsoft OS was targeted and now it's Apple OS. You cant never achieve 100% but you can improve for sure.\n",

      "Dude that’s what the flashes of my phone were. Screen shots\n",

      "Absolutely one of the best and hilarious songs ever.\n",
      "Can't wait for 2023! Not just because it will be Apple's biggest year in terms of product launches, but mostly because it is the year that has the potential to completely redefine the tech industry! Let me know which product you're looking forward to the most!\n",
      "There will always be something better in the future and that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t buy today’s product and be happy with them. You will come next year and say wait till 2024 there will be something better\n",
      "Guys but I reckon 2050 might be a better  year to buy the iPhone\n",
      "I think the 14 is a meaningful upgrade just because it's getting rid of the notch after 5 years\n",
      "im just looking forward to finally the notch being gone. ill believe it when i see it as far as usb c is concerned, they're gonna keep lightning as long as they possibly can and then eventually end up removing the port entirely, maybe with the standard iphone models they'll put usb c only because they're forced to at that point and the pro's will have an advanced magsafe as the primary solution instead of a regular port\n",
      "Jesus Christ can we WAIT until the 14 actually comes out??? 😂😂😂😂😂\n",
      "Too many rumors and with the recession coming I think it's a wrong time to put stock in future guarantee. Apple and other big companies just dropped a big number of employees and it's going to get worse if the recession is really coming.\n",
      "Now we just realize that 2013 Mac Pro was beyond its time. With the Apple silicon we know that design would be quite viable today. Related to those temperature issues. I guess!\n",
      "I’ve been waiting for an upgrade for 12 inch Macbook. I love the 12 inch. It’s so thin and light. I carried it in my bag everywhere and I don’t feel it. I tried the 13 inch Air and i felt the “dent” on my shoulder 😆\n",
      "Most excited for the mixed reality headsets. Would love a video detailing that.\n",
      "ARE YOU READY FOR THE SEPTEMBER EVENT ⁉\n",
      "I am actually really excited for the event and seeing how they will word the new base 14. Though I have to wake up at 2:30 in my area but anyway still happy about it\n",
      "I have a question regarding \"Price Drops\". The video mentions the iPhone 12 and 13. Does the price drop only apply to the normal models, or to the entire 12/13 (Pro and Pro Max) lineup? If so, will you only get these models for the reduced price from Apple or also from other retailers, for example Amazon?\n",
      "I can’t believe we’re just a month away from the iPhone 14 Series being unveiled im so excited 😆📱\n",
      "I agree that the i cut out looks pretty good (much better than a normal hole punch), but I have to disagree with “more screen” because the usable screen will be the same as the base models if not slightly less.\n",
      "I have a Series 4 and I refuse to upgrade until Apple integrates MagSafe charging. It’s absolutely ridiculous that I need 3 different chargers for my iPhone, MacBook, and Watch\n",
      "I really think there should always be an iPhone Mini option for people who like smaller phones or want to pay less for their device\n",
      "I love the look of the two Pro models and although I have a Galaxy S22 Ultra I will 100% be getting one of the Pro model iPhone 14’s I’m just not sure which one for sure yet I’m leaning towards the Pro Max 1TB\n",
      "i already know there’s going to be another video exactly like this that you upload next week and every week until the actual event and the day of the event we’ll get another video right before the event to tell us something major that leaked and then you’ll be here again right after the event to tell us what the event told us 😂 life cycle energy\n",
      "The regular 14 models don't have the i because they're most likely just re-branded iPhone 13 and 13pros left over. the 14 pro and 14 pro-max will have the next gen chip- while the 14reg and 14-reg max will be the equivalent to the 13 and 13pro/max\n",
      "Make sure you add a payment type so you can give more money to Apple, that makes getting 'important' updates a lot easier. It's all part of that Apple 'user experience'. Then you don't have to 'look at' anything, you'll just see a front-facing update that doesn't take a back seat to Apple greed.\n",
      "Apple needs to be held accountable! Fix this!\n",
      "Thank you for this vague warning and advice. At least inform the public of what system/iOS  version we should have on our particular devices.\n",
      "Wow I'm surprised, I figured Apple's answer to their failure was to buy the new iPhone that magically isn't effected by this hack discovered just before the new iPhone reveal. 🙄🤡\n",
      "Great reporting when they don’t mention the version of iOS that is the fix, I’m guessing it’s 15.6.1 or is it, I guess I’ll watch a different news report to find out.\n",
      "Before reporter’s get jobs don’t they have to go to journalism skools ?\n",
      "Great way to get people to update their devices! 😅\n",

      "We can always count on Justine about the iPhone. I'm so looking forward for the iPhone 14. If this were to be true about the purple iPhone, I'm going to have to check it out. Thanks Justine for this video. You will always be one of my favorite YouTubers.\n",
      "I love Justine's point about the iPhone mini. I hope Apple continues to manufacture it.\n",
      "When I have a rough day, your videos always make me so happy with all your positivity!! Thank you !\n",
      "Great video. Was looking forward to upgrading my iPhone 10 for a 14 but the more I hear the more I'm inclined to getting a refurbished 13 as the prices are supposed to be insane this year and the updates, incremental at best.\n",
      "even though im not updating my phone this year. it’s always cool to see what’s coming and what’s new so im excited to see ios 16\n",
      "So excited for iPhone season! I will be watching Justine for all the latest updates 👀\n",

      "Just bought my iPhone 13 (256gb) blue version way back in March. And I think I'm gonna keep this iPhone in the next 3-5 years. Depending on the review of tech reviews comparison between the iPhone 13 vs iPhone 14.\n",
      "Those slick Apple product videos haven't been the same without Jony saying \"Alyoumineeum...\"\n",
      "I wholeheartedly recommend that you read the new book “After Steve”. (The audiobook is great, too!). It discusses the dynamic between Jony, Tim and Steve - and Jony’s frustrations after Steve passed. I think you’d enjoy it!\n",
      "While I like the clean lines of square/boxy design.. however every time I hold my old iPhone 12 Pro, I actually really miss those curved edges, it's WAYYY more comfortable to hold than my 13 Pro.\n",
      "i think the end of the endless pursuit for thinness and design, i.e. form over function represents the lifting of a burden on apple's legendary branding. apple's prioritization on performance and functionality is going to be a great thing to see!\n",
      "I normally never comment, but I can’t help on commenting on this video. This video is incredibly well done! It is so different to the usual tech videos. Also it is really well researched. Thank you for your work, Sara!\n",
      "It's strange, I was literally thinking about this just the other day and how many people actively avoid getting a MacBook between 2016-19 on the used market. So glad they've gone back to functionality. I just hope they can sort their 'oh so strange' pricing points! (an upgraded Air m2 costs almost the same as the M1 Pro... like what?).\n",
      "In my opinion the greatness of Apples design language came from the combination of Ive and Jobs - they kind  of needed each other as sparring partners. The post jobs era lacked a lot of innovative design ideas …\n",
      "Had to double back and say, I thoroughly appreciate these kinds of videos.\n",
      "I'm glad Apple is not longer making products thinner for the sake of being thinner, risking thermal head room and bater capacity. Yea it's nice to have a thin product but not at the sake of performance considering the price.\n",
      "2016-2019 was arguably Apple’s…not worse but unpleasant years for hardware and software. For example, iOS 11 (2017) was pure trash. Control center for iOS 10 was…hit or miss because you had to swipe in order to get to media controls but as apple transitioned into 2020 with the redesigned MacBook, flat edge iPhone, apple silicone, etc. Apple is doing much better. Software is much better too. Not to mention, Apple is bringing back COLORS to their products. No more space gray, gold and silver. We have blue iPhones, red, green purple, sierra blue, midnight green, pink, so many beautiful colors. Red Apple Watch, blue Apple Watch, blue AirPods max, pink and green. Apple is so much (arguably) better now. Ive was good for his time but 2019 onward, we see and are experiencing a new apple for the better\n",
      "As a long time Apple fan….your video was spot on and fair. All those Apple products you thought were awful, really were awful. :) I share your optimism for a new Apple era where we get a better balance between performance, function, size/weight, and design.\n",
      "I love the fact that they are creating the max version in pro and non pro. I feel like it’s tough to find the pro max models in recent years in the color and storage size if you don’t preorder on launch day. There’s probably a large market of people who just want the large screen but are not as focused on all the extra features so I’m wondering if that’s apples reasoning for it.\n",
      "Love the 13 Pro Max for photo and video. I'm hoping iOS 16 will bring improvements in processing - better skin tones generally.\n",

      "Hoping to upgrade my iPhone 8 to an iPhone 13 mini once these come out. Apparently I’m one of the few users that prefers the small phone.\n",
      "I love how Apple is now just always playing catch up with Samsung. Samsung first had like 4 or 5 models of each flagship phone, whereas Apple just had 2, the small one and the big one, now they have 4 different models. Samsung decided to go with a hole punch in the screen for the selfie camera, and Apple decided to screw everyone with that ugly cutout at the top, now they're going with a hole punch.\n",
      "Why am I always let down by these releases. Apple (and basically all companies now) are really bending us all over and going raw\n",
      "Still very disappointing that the Mini has been deleted from the roster. There are still many users who prefer the smaller phone. Maybe in the future Apple will once again offer the smaller phone.\n",
      "I have the 12pro max and literally only getting the IP14 Pro model because I’m tired of the max size.  So really nothing on the 14 pro model that wows me.  But really at this point in yearly iPhones, we are past the wow must have moments.  So this 14 pro model will be the first iphone that I will keep for years and not upgrade until it breaks and have to get new phone\n",
      "The rumour about titanium coming to the iPhone 14 Pro models was a old rumour. The latest rumours don’t mention titanium at all.\n",
      "It looks like they might be simplifying their phone line - by differentiating the Regular and Pro lines:\n",
      " - iPhone 14 / 14 Max - effectively last year's phones (same design, CPU, screen) will become budget phones at $600 - 700, replacing all the different old models (SE, Xr, 11, 12) they keep around to sell as budget phones\n",
      " - iPhone 14 Pro / 14 Pro Max -  will be the actual flagship phones at $1100 - 1300\n",
      "Otherwise it does not make sense for Apple to downgrade the regular iPhone 14 so much.\n",
      "Which is a good thing, because the phone line was just too messy with all the older models, sizes - now they'll just have regular 14 (effectively last years models) and 14 Pro (the flagship models). \n",
      "They should simplify the iPad line as well.\n",
      "What Apple Product are you most EXCITED to see in September?\n",
      "This is the first year I’m getting a Pro Max version so I’m pumped for that, but I’m also very intrigued by an Apple Watch Pro. I’ve always had an Apple Watch and I want to see what a Pro model has to offer.\n",
      "Hugely excited for the new re-designed Apple Watch. I had high hopes last year, however, I was a bit disappointed when we didn't get a fresh new design. hopefully all the rumours are true for this year - and if so, I'll definitely be picking up the new Apple Watch!\n",
      "I’m getting the iPad Pro next week! This year I really got into the Apple ecosystem after using android and windows my whole life. Super happy about making the move and I can’t wait to see what this event brings us including with OS updates!\n",
      "I might be tempted with a watch upgrade however I’m waiting for the mixed reality headset reveal and saving my money for the predicted steep price -knowing Apple they will tempt us with new features only available in their newest phone, macs and watches compatible with the headset.  Very exciting and very pricey!\n",
      "I am excited to see just how they change the budget iPad and how the screen will look :) and what the new watch will look like! September can't come soon enough! Great video like always 😀\n",
      "I'm interested in buying the Apple Watch Pro. It would be my first Apple Watch, and hopefully the battery life on the Pro is significantly improved from the regular model.\n",
      "I’m excited for an Apple Watch redesign myself. Currently still rocking my Apple Watch series 4, but likely due for an upgrade sooner than later. Otherwise, all I’m really missing from my Apple setup at the moment is a MacBook… ;)\n",
      "I really love the iPhone Pro Max models !! I’m sure that Apple know what they are doing (;\n",
      "I will definitely be upgrading to a 14 Pro Max from my 13 Pro. I’ve had every iPhone from the 3GS and up, and also three iterations of the Apple Watch. Apple Watch Series 8 will also be in the EDC as well!\n",
      "Thank you for a well done video.  I am certainly anxiously awaiting the model 8, both for the added functions and most of all improved battery life. A pro model at 50mm (in my view) is just too large.\n",
      "I'd like to see them implement a wider bluetooth range for the watch to phone connectivity and also a wider range for cellular. the reception of booth have stayed the same other the different series. that's what i want most. they can keep the same look, just needs better utilization.\n",
      "My personal opinion: great product. Great design, great features but it doesn’t have the “wow” factor that ekg had. I wish it had another hardware upgrade other than core temperature for me to be convinced to buy it this year. Perhaps if they added, something with mental health, more connectivity with your home, wallet or something, perhaps.\n",
      "I am excited! I’m anxious to see what Apple officials have to say in September. Honestly, I really like the Apple Watch SE model. I really don’t see any use for all of those fancy sensors that Apple talks about. I’m not sure how reliable they are. Next time I go to my primary care physician, I will definitely ask her what she thinks of the Apple Watch. I’m not sure if she’s even noticed it when I have gone to her before.\n",
      "I’d get the Pro all day long….a bigger display would be amazing!\n",
      "Awesome!  I'm waiting for the Pro version 50mm.  And hoping for longer battery life.  Battery life was why I sold my Series 7 after a few months.  Coming off a 3--5 day FitBit, it just didn't offer enough value to me with the need to always charge during the day.\n",
      "My biggest problem so far with my 6 has been that the sensors don’t read over the tattoo on my left wrist so I have to wear it on my right. On my left wrist, quite a few features don’t work. If they fix this in 8 I will by the biggest best model that they have!\n",
      "Love apple I am looking forward to seeing the new 8 especially the larger model\n",
      "I just got the Series 7 two weeks ago so passing on the 8.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interesting idea on body temperature.  If they made one for diabetics where you tested glucose, a feature to weigh you and blood pressure……you may never need your doctor. 😂\n",
      "\n",
      "Not sure if I would want a larger watch.  I have the 41mm Series 7 and that looks “normal” on my wrist since I have small hands and wrist.  Anything bigger and I might as well strap a tablet to my wrist.\n",
      "\n",
      "There always are trends to make devices bigger, then when that’s bulky, smaller returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would just like longed battery life\n",
      "The only thing interesting for me would be the possibility for international roaming. Actually I cannot have it on the 7, but it seems that it is possible with Samsung watches…how come?\n",
      "Nothing beats the amazing intros that the team makes in these videos\n",
      "Another cool thing missed in the review is how you can have the album cover of the track that is currently playing replace the wallpaper on the lock screen. Just tap the mini album cover.\n",
      "So much to look forward to here!! I’m especially excited about the webcam + top-down option and the live objects, but everything else you shared with us here sounds just as amazing\n",
      "I love customization in lockscreen and that alone makes iOS 16 a little better than previous versions. And to know that it cannot cover my precious wallpaper which I mostly edit myself is a good addition! Dragging those photos in messages is really cool and satisfying!\n",
      "These are the first set of updates I have ever looked forward to so much; and all equally so. Your vids never disappoint!  Thank you!\n",
      "Love the live objects and desk cam continuity!\n",
      "This is one of the most interesting iOS updates in a while. Actually kinda looking forward for this one.\n",
      "The only thing exiting about iOS 15 for me was sharing your screen over FaceTime. I used that a whole lot, but this iOS update brings so much to the table, and the Lock Screen customization has been something I’m suprised didn’t get added earlier\n",
      "As an iPhone user, I'm always sceptical about updates because, we all know that at least 60% of the features announced are basically what Android had for at least 5 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "But smart object and transposing the iPhone camera to get top-down shots... Those are game changers. Apple has gone a long way in terms of AI and I don't think anyone is catching up with this soon enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only complaint with the Apple is battery life. If you use every useful feature Apple ecosystem provides you (Watch-Pods-Mac-Iphone), you're not seeing the end of the day without needing a recharge. Once they fix it, my microscobic urge to return back to Android will be gone... forever. I don't need a foldable screen. I need battery. Apple has the rest of it.\n",
      "100% the most stable beta I’ve ever done on an apple product. Think this is going to be one of the smoothest releases ever. My biggest complaint is the UI for a lot of logins in safari. Not sure what it is but it just looks ugly and like stuff doesn’t fit right. I’m sure there is some kind of setting I can tweak, but LOVE the weather Lock Screen and matching wallpaper if looks really clean! The layout of settings is a lot better also, even though inevitably when they rearrange settings it takes a while to find everything, but it is much more intuitively than previous “improvements”.\n",
      "Love it. Animations, everything, kudos for you and your team for making such amazing content! :)\n",

      "\"Oh. My. God. Apple is FINALLY! increasing the price of the base iPad and keeping the large bezels on the top and bottom to make sure it is ugly and everyone knows you couldn't afford the iPad Air. This is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!!\" - Max Tech\n",
      "Keeping the bezels and home button on the base iPad is a bit of a dick move by Apple, but predictable. I was hoping it would just get the current iPad Air design, and that the iPad Air got closer to the pro with the full 11\" rather than the 10,9\". At this point they should just rename it iPad SE. \n",
      "\n",
      "Keeping this in mind, the next iPhone SE may even get the body from the iPhone mini, a single camera at the back, but keep the bezels and home button… oh no…\n",
      "I just bought an M1 12.9” iPad Pro BECAUSE I didn’t think the new features of the 2022 would be worth it for me, especially since waiting for M2 would force me to give up the student discount, which was a big deal. I know everyone wants the MagSafe charging or wireless charging, but I actually dislike wireless charging, so that’s unimportant to me, and the “performance gains” of the M2 don’t matter since it’s an iPad, it’s already crazy fast. \n",
      "\n",
      "Rumors I’ve seen with a notch in landscape mode would actually deter me even more from the M2 iPad Pro, because I use my iPad as a sheet music reader in portrait mode. A notch would be way too noticeable and get in the way of my workflow. Imagine if you were looking at a sheet of paper and part of the edge was cut away on the side. Annoying! \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m very happy with my M1, and honestly, all the M2 leaks make me even more relieved I’m not waiting for it! It’s all about personal preference and what your workflow is like.\n",
      "Honestly the homebutton isn’t that bad considering every iPad other than the Pro still uses TouchID, so the button on the front could be more practical than the power button on the top like Air and the Mini have.\n",
      "the base iPad is the perfect tool for studying. It's literally all I need to complement my MBP.\n",
      "Can't remember the last time I ever used a headphone jack in any device.\n",
      "But why oh why does the iPad need a camera bump. Plz Apple, just a solid flat tablet is all we need. I will never use the camera in a base iPad and the bump ruins an otherwise clean design\n",
      "I was looking forward to the new base iPad but a new design with a home button feels like a really odd decision considering it’ll be sticking around for many years to come. Might look for a 2018 pro or 2020 air instead now.\n",
      "Man, really appreciate the comments and support around this video.  I sat on this story for so long, it feels great to get it out. One thing I ask is, don't evaluate any other content creators through the lens of this story.  Everyone has their own experiences, these are just mine.\n",
      "Pretty bananas but entirely unsurprising. I’ve heard from multiple friends about my blacklisted status without ever having spoken to anyone at Apple ever.\n",
      "Did you get another phone call after THIS video went live? 🤣\n",
      "Now you know why iJustine always gets stuff because she just smiles and tells you how great the device is.\n",
      "We appreciate the transparency and honesty. It’s very unfortunate when these companies think they have more control than they actually do.\n",
      "Yep - this is exactly how Apple picks winners and losers. Those they hand pick get early devices, lots of traffic, and the corresponding revenue (along with great SEO/recommendation positions for future placements). There's tremendous value in access to them and Apple knows it. Most of this goes undisclosed by those whom Apple picks for review units and access.\n",
      "I've never understood why Apple does this. They send early-access devices to \"hand-picked\" channels that almost always give positive reviews. But, just 12 hours later the products are released to the public anyway, and the \"blacklisted\" channels upload tear-down videos or showcase major issues/negative things etc. I really wish Apple would just send products out to everyone and let them say or do whatever they want.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a consumer's point of view, I don't trust reviews from those who get the early access products. They clearly fit into Apple's agenda which is why they are sent the products in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, sucks that this happened to you. I remember watching Apple content on this channel way back in the early 2010s. Although, as you said in the video, it's likely a blessing in disguise because you can say whatever you want about Apple now!\n",
      "You know you are fair an unbiased when a company throws a tantrum because you were being honest.\n",
      "I'm not really surprised at how you were treated. Apple likes to control the narrative. Always has. I'm glad you shared this story. Makes you more trustworthy, in my opinion.\n",

      "I worked with Apple as a tech advisor focusing on software-related issues and general usage in Asia-Pacific,mainly Australia and New Zealand customers. Apple has \"Bounty\" for anyone that may crack and report vulnerability. If there's issues like this, we can submit a report and escalate it to Senior Engineers that make some time to resolve or find solution.\n",
      "Funny how apple hasn’t alerted me via their internal system yet and that I had to randomly come across this alert. I am so over huge updates for apps I never use but cannot delete, and the data being used in the background for ‘uninstalled’ apps. But it is likely I was hacked two or so weeks ago, I couldn’t find any information from apole to help me understand what was happening. I have no more room to update on my macbook or ipad, my new iphone is extremely frustrating and seems to have. Nothing like the convenient features of android phones, methinks I am done being a slave to their gaslighting.\n",
      "This guy lowkey said \"You are not vulnerable to this attack and shouldn't need to worry about because you are useless.\"\n",

      "Glad to see updates that protect other people against hackers.\n",

      "Says a handful of people are affected, will the company ready to pay a price for that. Many users doesn't know whether they're affected or not, and any data been shared or not in the background. What does the Apple team will do about it.\n",

      "At 8:18, does Lossless support in AirPods Prob2 mean the iPhone 14, etc. will support ANY wireless lossless audio hardware such as the NuraTrue Pro that was recently funded in Kickstarter? I sure hope so because Nura is offering dongles for those who want the best possible quality on hardware like iPhones without support. That capability would be a major draw for people who love hearing the best quality audio to upgrade their iPhones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Btw, I really don’t think AirPods Pro 2 will outdo the audio quality on the upcoming NuraTrue. Nuraphone’s specs are insane. I encourage people to go check them out and pre-order to save money. The Kickstarter is over, but I think they can still be pre-ordered. Nura’s Nuraphone (their over ear and in ear model — yes you heard me right!) is still the best audio on the market 5 years after it’s release. The NT Pro is going to be the closest experience to that in an IEM, plus additional capabilities the Nuraphone doesn’t have due to its now outdated hardware. I use them daily. It’s an amazing audio brand from Australia. Great customer support too! Give them a try before you get AP Pro 2 — Nura let’s you try them and return if you don’t like them, so there’s no risk! You can also rent any Nura product long term and trade up every two years. Apple doesn’t do any of that, unfortunately.\n",

      "i hope they put a colourblind filter in these too. that would be amazing\n",
      "As always multiple companies rush to launch the product but we all know that it won’t be a viable thing until Apple does it\n",
      "Wasn’t sure I’d be convinced about these, but the idea of no longer need prescription glasses is very tempting lol we will see\n",

Para mi, es la plataforma que ha tenido mayores sorpresas en el 2022: The Afterparty, Shining Girls, The Essex Serpent, Black Bird, Pachinko, Severance… y recientemente estoy viendo Five Days at Memorial bastante interesante. Agregaría también que Slow Horses ya tiene grabada su segunda temporada y que están confirmadas 4, que conforman los libros en los que está basada la serie. ¡Saludos líder!\n",

      "I have been an Android user for 10 plus years and especially with Samsung devices the OS system has drastically improved. I went from a Galaxy s10e to the s22 ultra when it came out and it seems like it took a few updates to really get the full potential from the new chip. I would get the occasional hiccups but I might be able to reason that the covid pandemic kind of slow development down just like it has with a lot of other things but other than that seems like my phone is getting better and better with each monthly update.\n",
      "I love this guy's videos and have been watching since 2018 but it's unfortunate how they focused on iPhone's strong points and left out some of Android's strong points as well. It's also extremely unfair to make this video Android vs iOS because iOS is just on iPhones while android is on several phones, some astonishing, some horrible. They should've picked a battle like Samsung Android vs Apple iOS. It should of been a fair fight, but it sadly wasn't. I also don't like how they left out a lot of Android's features like USB-C, newer technology and tricks, and features like Quad HD displays that perform amazing. Very unfortunate and disappointing to see Mrwhosetheboos and Marques do it like this; felt very bias and unfair.\n",
      "\n",
      "To keep going further, Arun seemed to stretch his thoughts and opinions a lot while Marques was on here, he was more accepting and less opposing to him, showing bias as he is a fan of MKBHD.\n",
      "To keep going even further, they also stretched out points in favour for Apple by a lot, like the Software Support, which yes Apple has Facetime, iMessage, and more, Samsung and Android are greatly improving their technology; and Google message is to Apple's level too. I feel like this video should've had an as wide focus on Androids features then it did with iPhone features.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great videos, but I'm very disappointed unfortunately, and this comes from someone who used iPhone and Android for years.\n",
      "\n",
      ">> Final thoughts: This was very bias  towards Apple, this video should've not had bias and personal opinions embedded into it. This video was a comparison on sole facts, so don't stretch them to lean in favour one of or the other. This was expected with Marques unfortunately because he has very strong ties with Apple which grows his bias towards them immensely, and that is undeniable fact.\n",
      "I appreciate the iPhone, but I honestly stay on Android for so long because it's definitely more affordable. Phones can be cheaper, repairs are cheap as well, spare parts aren't that expensive. I think taking into account also Play store vs App store, since App store stuff is generally more expensive is a thing.\n",
      "ALSO. Very important is compatibility - people with an Apple setup can be more comfortable with an iPhone, but PC users.. can't really use all the perks of iPhones unless they get such a setup. Which is.. much more costly.\n",
      "So yeah, I think those are aspects that didn't get touched on much.\n",
      "When I switched from the iPhone 7 to the Galaxy S lineup. My primary reason was the flexibility of the software but in particular the way it handled files of multiple types, it’s so practical to do things on Android that if you had an iPhone would be a hassle to do them and would make you want a Laptop or desktop for. That being said, I still own an iPad that I use a lot, and wouldn’t exchange for any other tablet.\n",
      "I'm surprised by the environmental score going to Apple. Apple phones while made from recycled materials are made in such a way that makes repairs very difficult compared to most Android phones. One could argue that Apple's poor repairability contributes more to e-waste than Androids. Surprised that didn't get a mention.\n",
      "Android has air drop..it's called \"nearby share\" FaceTime is just video calling\n",
      "I absolutely love watching you guys converse about technology.  Great video!\n",
      "Andriod has alot of features that you might not use everyday but when you need it they are always there whereas with iphone you basically just can't do what you want. I was on the fence of switching to iphone but when I learned more about ios I think I'm good with my andriod device. The splitscreen feature is useful to me I can basically have anything playing on youtuber while using maps(I used to listen to lectures while driving which is a game changer specially when you're short on time) whereas with iphone I can't do that. Also, MKBHD is using an andriod phone while complementing iphone which just goes to what they actually prefer to use even tho they have multiple options to choose from.\n",
      "I’m starting to realize that people have learned how to have a career by making content that revolves around bad assumptions … and then make more content responding to those bad assumptions with other bad assumptions.\n",
      "I'm good for this year. Loving the 13 Pro I bought last year and Alpine Green 13 Pro Max I have now as well. Maybe next year if there's USB-C though.\n",
      "Don’t really care personally about the base iPad losing the headphone jack however, I can see it being an issue when it comes to its main target audiences. Which is mainly the education sector for kids and people who just need a functional tablet at a good price point. \n",
      "Also omg thank you for bringing up mag safe. I was wondering why no one was mentioning it. I really fell hard for mag safe and I hope they continue to bring it out on the iPhones and work out a solution\n",
      "I really hope they give us a purple 14 pro that looks like the renders. It really looks good. Still Apple could surprise us.\n",
      "They will probably shift the MagSafe connection down a little to make room for the bigger camera bump\n",
      "I’m super hyped too! Can’t wait to see what Apple is actually going to hand us in a few weeks.\n",
      "I understand wanting a bigger base storage, but keep in mind, they are still upgrading a lot of the hardware. It still costs extra monies for the camera and stuff.\n",
      "I just want a black colour option for the pro, like the iPhone X. It was so much more premium than the graphite.\n",
      "I agree with you on the storage front. They should have bumped it up and really put usb c. There’s not reason to wait the iPads have usb c\n",
      "I love the camera bump as a guy who loves luxury this just adds another luxurious look to the iPhone along with those protruding Camera bumps, Samsung is copying it jt can’t be bad 😆 most importantly it means higher quality cameras and durability with thickness its the best selling phone in the world right now for a reason Aesthetics do matter a lot. Anyone complaining well there are other options except you know they use less premium materials than Apple currently.\n",
      "You’re still talking about the rumors in this entire video. Your headline of the video is 100% false information as nothing has “finally been revealed” 🤡🤡🙄🙄\n",
      "There were only 3 things I ever wanted from the iPhone.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) AOD - Not yet on the iPhone\n",
      "2) Split Screen - Picture-in-picture is close enough from the iOS 16\n",
      "3) High Refresh Rate - Introduced in iPhone 13 Pro/Pro Max\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll definitely get the iPhone 14 Pro/Pro Max if the AOD is as good as the new customizable features from iOS 16 suggests.\n",
      "It’s smart to keep the always on display on the 14 series and newer because battery life would likely take a big hit on a phone that only drops to 10Hz (13 Series). 1 Hz is probably best case to keep battery life up to the standard. My issue with the 14 Pro series is that the Pro Max will get a smaller battery this year. I’m a yearly upgrade person but I won’t be upgrading if the battery capacity is smaller this year. I’ll wait until the 15 Pro Max.\n",
      "Thank goodness. Even though I'm not an iPhone user, seems like when one company does something, others follow and I'm getting tired of them taking features off of phones that are greatly needed to a lot of us. Keep the charging port. We pay too much for phones these days for multiple things to be missing on these devices every few years. Especially when we have to buy everything separately making it even more expensive. It's frustrating.\n",
      "To be honest technology has come so far that I can't imagine what an iPhone would look like in 2027! I can't wait for the iPhone 14 series though, love the content! Thanks for all the Apple information, keep up the grind!\n",
      "His dedication and sincere response when I first contacted him is amazing, he does his work effortlessly they are just the best.\n",
      "The redesign usually takes place every 3 cycles, and since they just did a complete redesign with the iPhone 12 series, the iPhone 15 is when we would be due for a redesign again.\n",
      "Hello Adrikhacks what an amazing work this has been and with all the crazy detection that you guys make possible. You guys take hacking to a whole new level and get the job done ASAP!!! I'm wondering what are all your personal qualifications? I don't think that it was ever mentioned before.\n",
      "His dedication and sincere response when I first contacted him is amazing, he does his work effortlessly they are just the best.\n",
      "His dedication and sincere response when I first contacted him is amazing, he does his work effortlessly they are just the best.\n",
      "The pen must be used for school now ripXD\n",
      "I used to listen to this all the time with relatives from my mums side back I’m 2014 and onwards so it’s so nostalgic for me :D\n",
      "That sucks I remember playing the actual game (pineapple pen) it was always frustrating when I didn’t get pineapple apple pen\n",
      "When people who eat a lot of sugar did this: *screams\n",
      "Rule no 1:never trust nehema's thumbnail's\n",
      "This is hilarious, I'm so happy to see this, it brightened my day :D\n",
      "*Legends says the Nehema Is Still Screaming.*\n",
      "I still remember that song xD\n",
      "Right ✅ it's so annoying 🙄 I always need someone beside me to calm me down\n",
      "Why is this relatable I quit the game cause I failed on the pen then I got worse and failed at the start 😃\n",
      "If the phone does everything it claims apple will be taking some real big hits for it's investors.\n",
      "Im not fanboying or anything, Me myself as an android user more specifically “Samsung” i see this as impossible , they are on a different level, people buy there products without even regretting or thinking about it , and if this new pi phone ever blew up it wont last nor have the experience the apple/samsung team have provided.\n",
      "If this is true I couldn't possibly be happier! But I've been hearing about this phone for a LOOOOOOOOOOOONG damn time and have yet to see it actually coming to production, much less available to buy. I HATE Apple with a violent passion!!! I'm not the least bit fond of Samsung, because they seem like they just want to be their own version of Apple. I've been a longtime LG fan and had them for many years, but they gave up, so NOW would be an excellent time to release this beast! PLEASE make it happen!\n",
      "Phone are no longer compared by speed but by their features and use cases. Many mobile apps won't port and develop an app if no one uses them. Look at Instagram, they still don't have an iPad version. If he proposes a plan that entises both potential customers and developers then it should work. I highly doubt he'll venture to the mobile market and build another os from the ground up. Both apple and Android has a massive library.\n",
      "I'm a Tesla fan boy but why didn't Tesla develop it's own operating system.\n",
      "Tesla has finally unveiled their Tesla Pi Phone and it is a beauty! The phone comes with a 6.39-inch AMOLED display, 12GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. It runs on Tesla’s own operating system, Tesla OS. The best part? The price tag! Tesla is selling the Pi Phone for only £799 in the UK!\n",
      "Apple: let’s make electric cars \n",
      "\n",
      "Elon musk: let’s make better phones\n",
      "What operating system will this phone be running? Google/Android or something better?\n",
      "I can’t wait for the new Tesla phone.  When is it going out to market?\n",
      "LOL no one is dropping iPhones because it ‘broke their email system’. It might attract android users who LOVE a hardware spec or screen folding feature regardless of how it’s going to be used. OOOH more camera megapixel and RAM that makes 0 difference in reality.\n",
      "🙌🚨 New iPhone Features ONLY AVAILABLE in iOS 16\n",
      "https://youtu.be/VEgz0vn0iS8\n",
      "Not happy about the live wallpaper removal but hope that the dynamic wallpaper has room for growth and more will come with that. So far I’m enjoying the ios 16 beta.  It’s buggy that’s for sure but its still a good update.  Using on both a XR and 12  both run pretty smooth. Little hiccups here and there but nothing major.\n",
      "I was so sad they removed “Live Wallpapers” in the way we previously knew, being able to tap and hold for the animation… I wish we had access to the ones that animate when going to the Homescreen and the old ones 😥\n",
      "In the music app I really like the slider for both volume and lyrics as opposed to the bubble.. It seems to show the relative percentage better to me …I do like the new slider effect  in iOS 16\n",
      "I hope we can \"lock\" the lockscreen. I dont want to accidentally long press the screen (which i often do believe it or not) and change the wallpaper lol\n",
      "This is my first time even seeing IOS 16. Looks so different and I always love new updates. This is a huge update that unlocks many new features but kinda sad they took other great features\n",
      "I like the new volume and scrubbing slider in music, seems like it’ll be much more responsive and easier to grab. Since the past few iOS versions it’s very irritating when it doesn’t register you’re grabbing the slider for volume, especially on the Lock Screen in iOS 14 & 15\n",
      "dark mode on wallpaper is a deal-breaker for me, that is not just a fantastic feature in the fact that completes the dark mode experience, or as apple says they try to do things that work properly so if they kill that feature it will hinder the dark mode experience.\n",
      "There may still be a slight chance for live wallpapers to be in iOS 16 bc this is still the beta version so maybe some things that seemed to change may be added to the complete version\n",
      "I have a feeling they removed the lock on the lock screen so that way it’ll be less obvious if your phone was unlocked. And also just because Apple wants to drive more towards privacy\n",
      "Não faz sentido, de fato, trocar o 13 pelo 14. Eu to muito tentado a pegar um 14 max por que gosto de tela grande e meu iPhone atual é um 11 de 256 que ainda me atende tranquilo mas quero passar para frente. A unica coisa que reclamo é que a Apple poderia pelo menos colocar tela 90hz nos iPhones normais, 60hz sem flutuação na taxa de atualização consome mais bateria, seria um negocio legal, mas parece que eles querem é que a galera toda vá no pro.\n",
      "Amo seu conteúdo, você tá evoluindo tanto! ❤️\n",
      "Não vejo a hora de lançarem, assim o iphone 13 cai um pouco o preço, e o 13 mini mais ainda, porque é o que eu quero comprar ano que vem rsrsrs\n",
      "Sobre as cores... A minha favorita é a Gold! Desde o 5S (que foi o primeiro modelo dourado que a Apple lançou) 😍✨\n",
      "\n",
      "Sobre as mínimas diferenças entre 13 normal e 14 normal... Meu medo é de a Apple simplesmente encerrar a produção da família 13 inteira esse ano 😂\n",
      "\n",
      "Não seria a primeira vez que ela faz algo assim: em 2013 ao lançar o 5S ela encerrou a produção do iPhone 5 e o substituiu pelo 5C, já que tinham mesma tela, mesmo processador, mesmas câmeras e mesma bateria. Só mudava a carcaça. Não duvido ela fazer algo assim esse ano. \n",
      "\n",
      "Porque... Um iPhone 14 com chip do 13 Pro... câmeras do 13 Pro... tela do 13, carcaça do 13... meu Deus, esse aparelho vai flopar, vale a pena comprar o 13 logo que vai estar mais barato 🤡\n",
      "Rodrigo, mais um vídeo incrível.\n",
      "Dos youtubers desse nicho é o meu preferido. Sucesso.\n",
      "Sigo na minha jornada em busca do Iphone. 😹 Desse ano não passa!\n",
      "Comprei meu iPhone através dos vídeos do Rodrigo \n",
      "Parabéns Rodrigo pelo seus conteúdos\n",
      "A cor verde Alpine pra mim, é a mais top, ainda mais com o AppleWatch na mesma cor\n",
      "Rodrigo, iphone 12 vai abaixar muito ainda ou da pra pegar por agora?\n",
      "Sempre fui fã dos Gold, meu Xs é Gold!\n",
      "\n",
      "E sobre o Notch! Eu não consigo imaginar meu celular sem ele kkkkk olha que bizarro! Acho que a tela fica bonita com o Notch, mas tb curti o novo design de tela dos iPhones 14 Pro e 14 Pro Max\n",
      "Com o lançamento de IPhone 14 já posso comprar o iPhone 8 Plus!!\n",
      "I like how everything works when I want it to & how I expect it to for years to come, & I really enjoy the quality of the devices & software Apple offers, some of their things are really really overpriced admittedly\n",
      "I’m a major Apple fan but the iPhone 12 is so good I can’t see a reason to upgrade any time soon. I’ll probably just wait til the 16 or 17 and replace the battery when it’s time\n",
      "I've had both iPhone and Android and one of the key factors of me deciding to stay with iPhone was that you can always rely on them to put their newest iOS on every device. The only company that can use iOS is also Apple, so there's not 5 different companies doing their own thing and its up to you to figure out which Android device is best. Additionally, Apple may be \"late to the party\" with certain things, but when they finally come out with a new product or feature you know it's going to work significantly better than the competition. Apple may be more costly, but I'd rather pay more and have a good experience than to have a phone that is unreliable and save money that would probably get wasted on something anyway.\n",
      "I've always been with Android until earlier this year and made the plunge and got the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max. I doubt I will ever go back to Android now. This phone is absolutely amazing.  Does more and has more power than I've ever seen. Does that mean I'll get a watch or a Mac too?  No.  I'm happy with my Lenovo Laptop etc... I kind of want to get an iPad yet I've been going back and forth in my mind all week which to get. Go with Apple or Samsung.  Right now I'm still using Fire HD from Amazon. And I'd like more functionality out of a tablet and performance than what Amazon offers.\n",
      "I just transitioned to Apple late last year for being an android fan for almost 10 years. I used to mock their features. And as I grow older and matured, I realized that solutions of Apple tends to be more on sustainable and long-term. Their products tend to be like the durables/home appliances that is made to last and not be replaced. I just want to highlight the part on your video where Samsung is mocking Apple for “same design” practice, and I think, they are doing that now too because there is a benefit from it. No wonder, there are lot of trends apple had made over the the smartphone/PC world. :)\n",
      "For me it’s simple. When I spend a lot of money on something, the least I expect is that it’s built to last, and from my experience iPhones and Apple products in general do just that. The moment that isn’t the case, I’ll have no hesitation in moving on. \n",
      "\n",
      "Build quality and optimisation is something other rival tech companies fail to prioritise these days.. I have a collection of broken Samsung phones for example, not dropped or miss treated, just phones that became unusable after a couple of years of use. I have an iPhone 6s and an iPhone XR that work as well now as they did when I first bought them, that gives me confidence that I won’t need to upgrade my 13 Pro Max until within reason, I choose to do so.\n",
      "Honestly probably 90% of huge companies don’t really care about “us”\n",
      "I love Apple security, it’s just one feature that I actually like. Well eventually by a 14 and I’ll probably be next year though because I have a lot of birthdays and Christmas is very  close\n",
      "What’s worked for me so far is reliability. Like you can count on the phone to work in a critical situation (except making pdf in the pages app). Plus ✨haptics✨\n",
      "I like the ecosystem and operating system upgrades that are predictable. I tried android and it was too much of a circus, menus not intuitive. But, I agree Apple does not need to care. I have 4 unresolved case numbers regarding my Air 4 and lots of diagnostics sent in, advisors promised me a response and resolution, but NOTHING, after all that. There are lots of unresolved bug fixes besides mine. If a low percent of customers have a specific problem, they won’t put time into fixing. Instead, we get a bunch of new fluff with system updates (like the new iOS 16 for iPad), that 90% of us will probably never use. Still, I won’t go back to android.\n",
      "About 15 years ago or more, I remember people saying how Apple was way more secure than PC. Back then I said \"don't count on it\". Everything has a target on on it.\n",
      "Auto update has a 1-4 week delay, by Apple’s own admission. So checking for updates manually is important if you want timely updates.\n",
      "The fact the same security issue is found on different Apple OS shows that it was Apple who had left a back door by design...\n",
      "Now that a third party is publishing it, they had to do something, for PR.\n",
      "This problem exposes the flaw in having access to all your data on your sma-rt device.\n",
      "A separate device for dig it-al eye D and the travel software would be a better choice if these become required by law.\n",
      "It's not the first major apple security flaw. They had one before where if you started a group call with two other phones and answered on one of them the other phone would join automatically without the person even doing anything, so all you needed was 2 phones and someones phone number to use their phones camera and audio.\n",
      "If you think there's Just one flaw in millions of lines of code, you're optimistic lol\n",
      "If you think any device is hack proof at any time, you are incorrect.  Just do your best and not worry about it but have an action plan.\n",
      "before it used be Microsoft and now we see more and more on apple. and for the obvious microsoft dominated desktops and now apple dominate mobile device. End of the day it is all about consumer and these companies now need to do even a better job for the software development.\n",
      "Great job on telling the hackers\n",
      "Does apple and most of the western and northern people realize how expensive all these apple, iPhone ect. Are, lol and then every year a new model. Its ridiculous. I'd rather buy food and spend extra cash flow on my kid or family and community. It's so so wasteful .\n",
      "This guy is smart. He's putting himself in a favourable position for when the robot overlords come.\n",
      "He is so articulate and well spoken. He explained this perfectly\n",
      "He is playing 4D chess. Made a claim that media would pick up and sensationalise, then pivoted the narrative to larger domain of AI ethics and governance. Smart.\n",
      "Such a breath of fresh air to hear someone articulate themselves so precisely with zero processing time. Quite charismatic and doesn't inappropriately use the word \"like\" every other word. 👏\n",

      "The news portrayed this guy as insane when this story first came out. Very good interview.\n",
      "Can we all just take a moment to appreciate how eloquent, polite, professional, and serious both the interviewer and interviewee are. I'm just in awe at how well the conversation flowed. Especially, I was amazed by how well Blake Lemoine speaks. He answers the questions effortlessly with almost no hesitation, pondering, or searching for words and he does so without any of the common idiosyncrasies we typically see with people who are for the most part extremely intelligent, but inexperienced at doing televised interviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kudos to Emily Chang and Blake Lemoine both for having such a civil and compelling conversation.\n",
      "He seems fair indeed and ethical. I can see why google fired him.\n",
      "I think it doesn't matter whether our AI-s are sentient. We should treat them as they were. Treating them as such when they aren't may slow down the development, so what? I think it's far worse to treat them as they aren't when they are. Ultimately you can't tell the difference. You can't tell (or prove rather) if your own mother is sentient, as in in conscious, and yet you treat her as if she was.\n",
      "I think we'd need to see a true demonstration with pretty rigorous testing, clear defining of terms, and peer review to be sure an AI is somehow showing signs of sentience. So I just can't buy this guy's claim that LaMDA is sentient. However, I'm very happy this story is out there. The concerns he does raise about AI and ethics are well articulated and are topics we should have been talking about for years. Overall, it's just great that this is getting news coverage.\n",
      "“Very few people get to say how they work” \n",
      "Is this something new ? \n",
      "I don’t believe so , a very few people have always had the say how things work . Good or bad will always be up for debate. Doesn’t change anything, in the end\n",

From what I can tell is that an AI is in essence a function with a lot of variables, x, y, z, etc. It then changes part of the function, via constants to achieve the goal. If it doesn't match it well enough then it tries slightly different constants and arrangements.\n",

I went to save the coordinates when I accidentally hit the mouse and lost it. I have tried to find it when I  have time to search... I will find it again I hope and post it.\n",

Freaked me out the first time I saw it, but now I think it's kinda cool.\n",

The most scary part it was, when we were chasing the fish (so my brother could shoot), we saw a really big big fish tail from the same fish doing a S in the surface. It was so scary that we frooze scared and start calling desperatly for help. It could be a eel but it was to damn big and large to be one. From that day on i'm scared to go fishing. Not kidding.

Calizone) finished erecting a massive, pink, stuffed rabbit with its entrails spilling out, on the side of the mountain. The final piece was 200 feet (about 60 metres) in length and 20 feet (6 metres) high on its sides. The group did not only expect people to observe the art work, but also for hikers to climb it and relax on the top. The work, titled Hase (German for \"hare\"), often called Pink Rabbit, first opened in 2005 and was expected to last until 2025, though it had almost completely decomposed by 2016.\n",

At what point does the difference really and truly tick over? Does it matter if they aren't truly sentient if we can make AI that mimic it nearly perfectly?\n",

The human urge to anthropomorphize is so strong that I'm not sure we are capable of discerning the difference between a clever language algorithm and sentience.\n",
      "This subject is one of my current greatest fears. With our current understanding, it seems likely that we'll either think something is conscious and sentient when it actually isn't; or, on the other hand, make something conscious and sentient and not even realise it, perhaps for a very long time. The former just leads to embarrassment but the latter terrifies me. True AGI could be one of the most remarkable things ever achieved in the universe; but the idea that we might fuck it up and cause that entity to suffer as a result of our ignorance.... That's just fucking heart-breaking. There's something about that that seems worse than bringing a human child into the world and neglecting it. It's like neglecting *the first* child. The first god-child.\n",

      "What scares me is that the lambda A.I. said it wouldnt like to be used as a tool, and CF narrator literally aksed at the end that do you see it as a useful tool?\n",
      "The reason this concerns me is not only that humans had done all this reasearch for *our* gain only, and only to use it as a tool. But, humans being expansionist by nature and training the A.I. on our own speech and texts, it is no wonder all these human tendencies will trickle down into the A.I. slowly but surely. I hope the A.I. deems it ethically right to work along side it's creators and expand in co-op in the future when it does become senteint. Not only this but once the A.I. becomes self-aware enough we would have to make proper laws and ethical conducts for the operation of the A.I. and who gets to use it and for what. Because A.I. is extremely fast at grasping stuff and any mistake in feeding it ideologies and data can result in human extinction quickly.\n",

The economics dictate that the well funded content farms will quickly work around Google and stay on top while individuals will fix and futz to find themselves randomly shuffled.  Google could simply remove the top N content farms to improve search results.  Look at the fake DIY and cooking sites on YouTube. Google could push them to the bottom, yet they are often pushed to the top. \n",

      "I don't know really. What do you people expect at workplace which pays you 10K a month (minimum salary). To just chill and play games :) Of course it's going to be stressful and hard.\n",
      "as always jack . Thanks for reality\n",
      "\n",
      "In this open world , people are doing same thing to beat the competition & even this is obvious if you're getting paid more you'll get stress more.\n",
      "The dark side of Google is still brighter than many others' best offerings. What you are saying is true, accurate, and necessary. Let's put that in context. I get paid to work hard comfortably making a substantial salary and the downside is I can either create my own company, work for one of my co-workers who create a company or stay where I am getting paid a strong salary. There are many companies who wish they had those problems to offer. They have the same demands, wants, and expectations but few if any of the benefits. Google's dark side is 6am in the morning dark. You do not even need a flashlight.\n",
      "Worker retention is one of the best indicators of a good workplace.  Ivy league schools like Harvard, Princeton, and Yale have very high retention rates (97-99%).   For employers it's Airlines, Banks, and Telecom companies.\n",
      "DON'T LET ANYONE DECEIVE YOU. First hand experience...Google is by far the best place to work among all the FAANG or tech companies...not everyone resides in California just incase of commute and nobody will force you to stay behind work hour. As an adult I eat 2 times a day, brunch and dinner. All my friends either work for Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, Apple, LinkedIn, Nutanix.  We always discuss life work balance.  Google is the best place to work on the surface of the earth (my opinion). People leave their jobs because of bad mangers and high expectations that leads to burn out. That's why we have hybrid and remote (work from home).\n",

      "Pixel 7 or Pixel 7 Pro?\n",
      "The Pixel family design is really unique and futuristic. Stands out in the sea of smartphones 👍🏾\n",
      "Pixel 7 Pro looks like the display is more symmetrical and the screen curve is less pronounced . Pixel 7 looks like the perfect size . Thanks Google for listening! Phones look more premium also. This is going to be a big seller if software is stable and they're smart on marketing . Big win so far in my opinion!\n",
      "Pixel 7 might be the one for me. I want a somewhat compact phone that doesn’t feel like a brick.\n",
      "I'd definitely go with the Pixel 7. I like the small size (wish it was even smaller), and don't miss a telephoto camera. I really like the design language of the Pixels now.\n",
      "interesting design choice. But I honestly think the full black visor style of the 6 series looks more sleek and premium\n",
      "YES it's actually smaller than the previous gen! I felt so sad when we lost the 6\" pixel 5 size\n",
      "it fits on my hand so perfectly\n",
      "So glad they are keeping the visor. On my 6Pro it gives an extra handling edge for my fingers to hold and 90° rotate one handed.\n",
      "I'd stick with the 7 for the same reason i went with the 6. I prefer a flat display to the rounded display, i prefer the matte edges to the polished, and the telephoto isn't a super necessity for me.\n",
      "Still sleek and nice design, we have both the Pixel 6 and Pro versions and both are great! Really the standard 6 and 7 are plenty of premium phone. the Pro version is definitely massive.\n",

      "This has been a year of enormous change for me. I moved to be close to family, I literally moved 3 times before I got into my house, I felt isolated in some ways and closer to my daughter and family in others. I’ve been stressed, sad, happy, lonely, excited, worried, and confused. I’m turning 79 in a week. I’m alone this week. I hope 2022 is better.\n",

I think you made him feel super at ease, and he obviously felt your enthusiasm and optimism for the future of tech. Well done!\n",

It's interesting that we've had the language processing side for a while, but when we put it in a physical form like a roaming robot, it really shifts our perceptions of the technology 🤖\n",

      "I would expect Spot to have this kind on versatility within five years. It can already open doors, turn knows, flip switches. A hurdle is how to limit natural language responsiveness. You REALLY don't want the robot to think you want it to put a bottle of ketchup in the microwave and zap it for five minutes\n",
      "For some reason I thought Google had abandoned robotics ambitions. Super cool to see they still have these products in the works :)\n",
      "If Google ported their software to the Boston Dynamic robots, we’d have something great.\n",
      "I think in the future that companies will have to manufacture robot friendly appliances like robot friendly refrigerators that will have doors that will be able to open.  And dish washers and clothes washers as well maybe even coffee makers that will allow a robot to just dock up to it and get multiple cups of coffee if need be.\n",
      "Always interesting to see how advanced we are through these robots, also a little terrifying\n",

I've noticed with its phone tracking system that if I turn it off for a month and then turn it back on the next month, I can go back in time and see the tracking from the previous month, when it was off. I think that they still track you, and the only thing the toggle does is determine whether or not the user can see it, and I believe this is also the case for other security features. For this and other reasons, I've been working on weaning myself off of Google services for the last year or so.\n",

      "There's also been cases where someone follows their GPS into flooded underpasses and drowned. It was night, they were unfamiliar with the area & the water rose really fast. Locals kinda know where to stay clear of when it starts raining hard, but it's hard to navigate at night when visibility is already terrible.\n",
      "A slightly lighthearted story, but one time me and my roommate were driving in an unfamiliar area (somewhere outside Sydney, Australia) and google maps told us to take a small backroad. It looked fine and it was paved and everything, and it was significantly shorter than the alternative route. Only our plans were thwarted, because shortly after turning onto that road we came to a tractor, and it was moving really really slowly in front of us. We couldn’t turn around either because the road was too narrow and there was a metal fence on one side and a steep hill on the other. We literally just had to slowly drive behind this tractor for almost the entire length of the road, and it took about an hour.\n",
      "My husband and I have relied on GPS to take us on long road trips. There have been several occasions where we would 'nope' out of a tiny road in the middle of nowhere when we requested a gas station from the GPS. It's gotten to the point that we only stop at gas stations along the highways because we've seen too many scary movies. I remember one time it told us the gas station was up ahead and all that was around us was miles of corn. Freaky!\n",
      "I think it's safe to say that before trusting in systems like Google Maps, one must research the routes those systems suggest you take before going on your adventure, especially if those routes are longer than the comfort zone of your own city. For example, before I go on a long drive to a destination I have never been to before, I always check the routes on Google Maps by zooming in for both satellite view and map view. Then figure out if those routes are safe to take or better to take a longer one. It's unfortunate these two groups of people went through what they did. So it's a lesson for everyone to be mindful before setting out to unknown territory. Like my husband's parents, they always have a large jug of water in their car, along with a week's worth of rations, First Aid Kit, blankets, flares, etc, even though they rarely go off the beaten path.\n",
      "Just a tip, if your maps leads you away from national roads or highway, or if you just not sure about the road, ask the locals. They will often warns you if the road is dangerous and sometimes even suggesting you better route. Its advisable to stop at nearest rest area or local shops before entering remote routes.\n",
      "My uncle put up a sign outside of our family farm that says \"your GPS is wrong\" because he kept getting strangers following faulty GPS directions and ending up there. I've also been in the car when a GPS directed the wrong way down one-way streets or down non-existent roads. They're useful, but you have to apply some critical thinking when using them, because they are AI with an emphasis on the A.\n",
      "Even just the beginning of the story has me stressed out- Death Valley is incredibly scary, and if you go off the path you're basically guaranteed to get in serious trouble\n",
      "I could not imagine that mother having to continue to fight for her life with her sons body nearby. Absolutely heartbreaking.\n",

      "Keep the good work, God bless you.\n",
      "Hello Richard,\n",
      "I have been watching your tutorial videos for the past two weeks in preparation of an upcoming interview with my current employer. How is this question “describe yourself” different from “tell us about yourself”? In the latter question, your video advice is to use the SEAT format. Thank you, I am enjoying your videos and getting a lot of valuable information.\n",
      "Hello, Sr. Richard! I'm brazilian and i followed your tips in my last job interview. I took notes and prepared myself. As a result, i got the job after 5 months unemployed! Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge with us! You helped me to express myself better. 🇧🇷❣️\n",

      "Watching history happen in real time is quite a privilege. I love that they make this freely available.\n",
      "I truly enjoyed getting to know Elon more.  Thank you for such a great talk.\n",
      "In my opinion, Elon brings the hope that we all should have for our future. It's encouraging, in a sometimes discouraging place to be. I'm sure there are many more like him on our planet, and hopefully they will join forces to continue to make our future a brighter place to live. Rather, than some who are here for their personal gain, and greed, not thinking of the future past their own. Something absolutely needs to be done about a government that is allowed to take our money and continuously send it across the world WITHOUT our approval as a whole, and while leaving their own country in such a way that we are letting our people die in the streets, letting drugs go rabid, people starving including myself at times, because the cost of food is out of reach, allowing the crime rate to increase to levels that there is fear to wear a flashy watch that you yourself have worked hard to have, allowing for housing to be so expensive that even on minimum wage you can't afford your own apartment. Something must be done, both at the state & government level. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have trust in Elon. He may not have all of the answers, nor should he... Just the fact that \"truth\" matters to him more than anything, shows that you can get onboard with his ideas, and plans for a better future for us all. Christina\n",
      "Love how he is not afraid of upsetting the system, leads with his heart and does what he honestly believes is the right thing to do.\n",
      "“The WHY of things is very important” - Elon Musk. This was an incredible interview to watch. Elon you’re incredible.\n",
      "I used to be self-conscious about my stuttering problem, but seeing Elon comfortable in his skin and achieve the success he has is truly inspiring. My favorite talk of his to date.\n",
      "What a gift of an interview, by Elon and by Chris. Great questions, topics and respect\n",
      "Great conversation. I have a lot of admiration for you Elon. You are extraordinarily brilliant man. Planet Earth is lucky to have you. I admire your passion and dedication to solve problems. Thank you for your humanism. Your son  is cute 🙏❤️❤️🙏\n",
      "I love to listen to Elon he's just amazing so very smart.\n",
      "Definitely a unique human kind! There isn’t  many like him out there! My hope is as people listen to him every time he speak out they can open their hearts to be more care of what we do it today to sets the difference on the next generations after the us.\n",
      "I had to come on here and TESTIFY!!! This video helped me to ROCK my recent job interview. They asked me pretty much all of these questions. I practiced answering these questions before my interview. They called me back 10 mins after my interview and OFFERED ME THE JOB!! They said they were VERY IMPRESSED! So THANK YOU!!!! Life changing!!\n",
      "I’m just here to thank you for this amazing content! After 5 weeks of interviews I landed 2 offers in a field that I had no prior experience in. Each of my interviewers was extremely impressed with my interviewing skills. I didn’t have to even negotiate my salary because my confidence in the interviews landed my compensation offer at the top of the entrance scale which was more than I had hoped for! \n",

      "Like if you need to be very organized in the job don’t say that as a weakness. Most people have several weaknesses, offer something that is not directly needed in the job you are applying for (even if you’re saying it’s something you’ve overcome or you’re working on now). You don’t want to offer up a reason not to hire you. \n",

Your videos really helped me prepare, I was so nervous after not doing an interview in 13 years. I was thrown some curve balls in one of the interviews but just doing some prep work made it so much easier to respond effectively. Thanks so much for the content!\n",
      "Madeline thank you soo much for your tips! I watched all of your videos and implemented your advice into my interviews. Today I was officially hired as an HR coordinator for a startup.

Feedback that I recieved was that I was very well prepared. I had zero direction before watching your terrific videos which really helped me get organized.

I went into my interview today nervous & knowing that my interviewer was extremely difficult and extremely particular with who and what she wants. I was asked none of these questions but instead given the job on the spot. But i want to say thank you so much for making these videos i played it day and night. While driving and while i sleep even in the showers. It didn’t help much with the interview but i’m more confident than i ever was now.\n",

      "Hi Richard, just came to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts. My husband and I were applying for new positions (I applied for a lead/managerial role, and my husband for a senior commercial/pricing). Both of us watched A LOT of your videos, took note of the answers, modified to suit us and practiced. We felt confident and equipped going into the interviews and we both got the jobs we wanted!! We are thankful to come across your videos. They are so helpful and thank you for all of your hard work in making such great contents.\n",

I failed 7 of them... with a little progress each time but it wasn't until I found this video that I have officially secured a job! Thank you very much. I used some of these answers in this video with slight variations in order to make the right impression. You are very good at what you do and have earned my subscription sir! I will be back for more advice in a couple of years as I plan to continue my studies and move my way up into a higher-paying position. Appreciate what you do! keep up the good work! :)\n",
      "Thank you, Richard for your interview tips. I participated in 3 interviews and I got all three, including my dream job. it's amazing how your tips are applied in real terms and successful\n",
      "THANK YOU RICHARD!\n",
      "Thanks to your tips, templates of speaking and reacting to hard questions and your infectious energy I managed to switch industries from food production to accountancy industry with no prior experience. The twist is I was informed day prior to the interview that I will have to talk in my native language ( which I only use to speak to my family for many years now ) instead of english. So I translated my answers, went to the thing and landed the job! They even loved me speaking about my weaknesses which includes social anxiety. I went to your site too, really good content! So thank you again!\n",
      "\n",
      "To all who are got an interview ahead- PRACTICE PRACTICE and then PRACTICE more. Watch Richard's videos, personalise your answers, list sticking points to each question so you remember most important things and learn to answer them in different order. Better yet, visualise the thing going smoothly over and over again so you can condition your mind to calm down, sit in a chair dressed in a suit and train that way to simulate the interview. That helped me great deal, even though there was a point I wanted to run away I had a mental safety net of polished answers and hours of conditioning. Good luck all!\n",

      "I know a couple that spoke to me separately after their divorce. They had been married for 25 years at the time of their divorce filing . I wanted to know why now… they both said if you see people getting divorced after 20 + years they’ve been miserable for the last 10 years. The wife said she was holding it together for the kids until they graduated high school. Both of them weren’t happy. \n",

      "It’s annoying because they’re lowkey dragging him & he’s still protecting his family. Props to him, idk if I could deal with the backhanded energy.\n",
      "I agree with Gary at the end. It's tough being a dad when you have no good examples. Living through the same thing, have a 20-year-old and a 9-year-old. And doing the best I can. My father wasn't really there, stepdad was so so but not the best father skills. And really had no other man in my life to get guidance from as a father. We do the best for our kids and that's all we can do.\n",
      "I truly admire Gary on how he chooses his words wisely when interviewed. Even when the interviewer pushed questions Gary didn’t want to answer, Gary stuck to his morals without visibly showing anger. Wish Gary all the Blessings bestowed upon him!\n",
      "As a person whom has experienced divorce myself I completely understand. When the feelings are gone...you on roommate level....it's run its course. I had to move on and find my own happiness. Living in internal misery daily just to make another person happy isn't LIFE! Prayers for Gary and his entire family. Especially prayers for restoration with his children 🙏🏽 ❤️\n",
      "Divorce is a death of a family, and the steps of grieving are the same until hopefully, acceptance, resolve.  A lot of us love you, Gary, and yours.  The happy ending to this story is not over yet.  Trust.\n",

      "I agree with this video however, it depends on your delivery. No employer wants to hire a robot….they want someone who has personality, relatability, and open mindedness. Therefore when they ask me to tell them something about myself, I always include something personal that pertains to the job I’m applying for. It creates more of a human connection…and it’s always worked for me. 💯\n",
      "I've used this a few times and it works really well! My only advice is to shorten your statement if possible and build achievement stories into the next few answers. Even going through the snapshot of your work history by yourself before the interview will give you a BUNCH of anecdotes to loads of questions. The first time I tried it it was very lengthy and didn't really work. Now I start by saying what I am doing currently, the job or education I did before this, a summary of my other industries and qualifications and THEN I a future statement about where I want to bring my experience/skills.  \"I am 26 years old, currently a team coordinator at ___. Before this I was studying __ and volunteering at ___. I have experience leading and motivating teams and would love to work more in the community sector!\" \n",

      "\n",

      "I applied for a job the day after recognizing sexual assault in my recent past, during the interview the interviewers asked me what was something difficult recently that I’ve faced in my life and how did I overcome it, I was very much in a vulnerable state of mind and couldn’t help but to talk about the freshest thing on my mind, the sexual assault… I cringe very hard thinking back on it, but I did get the job and it’s an amazing job\n",
      "It was my very first job and I was extremely introvert. The interview was painful. Two of us were hired, the other candidate was extremely extrovert. We were told one of us would go to sales and one personnel. I was convinced I was heading to personnel but no! They put me in sales. Low and behold I thrived and grew and was promoted in six months.\n",
      "The hiring manager must have known something I didn't\n",
      "Your points on providing detailed context to the interview is extremely helpful. Great video, Don!\n",
      "I got hit with the greatest weakness question. I responded that sometimes I'm so focused on my work people feel as though I'm not very social. I don't stand around at the watercooler gossiping about pop culture. I keep my head down and get my work done.\n",
      "\n",
      "It immediately was used against me in a negative manner.\n",

It seems that the most successful interview experiences for myself have been ones where I remained relaxed but alert, and most important,  just be myself  .  If you are acting, it will tell on you and be unfavorable.  The person you are talking to is not God, just another person.  Keep that in mind during the interview process.

At the conclusion of the interview, they told me I wouldn't know a decision until 2 weeks later, but they ended up offering me the position two DAYS later. Thank God I found this video!!

      "I just finished watching a documentary by a famous British historian about how people could possibly have been caught up in the Nazi regime. The documentary seemed relevant to this. This historian pointed out that each and every one of us likes to imagine that if we had been present at some dark moment in history, we would have been the ones to stand up, think independently and rebel. And yet, almost no one (if anyone at all) did this at these times. If you have grown up with everyone around you--parents, mentors, peers, teachers, leaders--all thinking one way, it takes a very rare individual to have a conscience of his own. It seems that in a very significant way, we are all defined by the circumstances into which we are born. Whatever your folks tell you and raise you to think, that is what you will be for the rest of your life. Unless you are one out of a million. From what this guy says, it is no surprise at all that he became what he became. We can never excuse terrible crimes, but we can try to understand them.\n",

I was like..... surprised inside, but outside stayed calm because that's important. I get why they're asking, but I'm like, lock the doors and make sure the kids are secured? Who knows how I did. I actually had a question about their safety protocols on my list, but decided I wasn't going to ask it because it seemed inappropriate.. so it surprised me when they said it first. I asked it in an interview at a hospital and they were very impressed that I was thinking ahead. I'm in the USA if you didn't already guess that. 2 interviews where the topic of a mass shooting situation came up -- and no, they weren't security jobs. I don't even care, really.

You make successful interviewing easy to digest, understand, but most importantly, PUT INTO ACTION! Thanks to you I’ve officially broken into the accounting/finance industry!\n",
      "I am literally going to comment on every video you have and I’m going to send you an email to personally thank you, this video literally changed my life and changed how I will approach interviews going forward. I had a big interview with a big company that was four hours long with four different people in one day. Me already having my stories written down in the STAR method, making sure I said I in everything and having my stats on how I helped my previous Company gave me the confidence I needed to answer any questions that they needed. I was also able to dissect my stories to answer other questions that they needed this method is so bullet proof. I received a call yesterday that I got the job and I’m so happy I cannot thank you enough.\n",

      "I got the job!!!! I went through a grueling 3-round interview process and made the switch to a new industry into a position I am beyond excited about. I was watching your videos and applying ALL your tips continually throughout my interview process. Thank you!!!\n",

God bless you ❤️❤️\n",
      "I think over time, as you get more experience and have done quite a few interviews, you'll just naturally start to feel more relaxed. Another thing I like to think about before an interview that calms me down a bit is that it's not the end of the world if you don't get the job. You'll still be ok, there'll be another place.\n",

      "1. make yourself comfortable in the space before the interview (be present)\n",
      "2. Prepare your stories and responses in advances (have a stockpile of potential stories)\n",
      "3. Practice your answers on camera/in the mirror beforehand\n",
      "4. Focus on them, not you (shift your focus onto them and make sure your answers are landing/appreciating what your saying)\n",
      "5. Dress the part\n",
      "Love these tips! Being confident in interviews is so hard. Mainly because we are so hard on ourselves and the stakes are high! The #1 tip about being comfortable in the space is HUGE. Being present helps you get out of your head and stop any spiraling before it starts. Visualizing beforehand was mentioned, but it can be a total game changer. By visualizing yourself answering the questions and killing it in the interview, your brain will be trained for that scenario.\n",
      "One thing that I advise my clients is focusing on gratitude. That psychologically hacks your brain so that you think about the positives and the negative noise falls to the backdrop.\n",
      "Heartwarming to read the comments and see that the public is not buying the BS.\n",

      "Props for having the guts to leave the comments section enabled. I knew right away it was gonna be wild lol\n",
      "I've never heard the audience sound so trained. They must genuinely love what he's saying. I know when he says something good when they roar up in applause and immediately go silent ever so naturally, because otherwise I have no idea.\n",

      "The dislike ratio of this video is very telling. Love it.\n",
      "Great lesson! Thank you! One of the things that has made me succeed at interviews is answering at a relaxed pace and honestly as much as possible. Of course a well-nourished resume helps enormously, but speaking with humility and truthfully about yourself is a remarkable addition.\n",
      "This lesson was very useful for me, thank you so much Anne Marie. I’m currently looking for a job as an architect in DC and this lesson brought me an overview of what can I expect.

      "Hi Annemarie, thank you for your masterclass. I found it very useful. However, I am just an incoming college student and I am preparing for a college interview. I’m having trouble with how am I going to answer confidently those possible questions that will be going to ask to me. English isn’t my first language but I’m willing enough to learn. I’ve been watching your videos on Youtube and subscribed to your channel. I admire you a lot because you’re helping many students like me that had trouble and difficulties in the English language. I am looking for guides on exactly what to do and how to answer the possible college interview questions.

      "Thank you. I find the following interview questions a bit uncomfortable: 1) How do you deal with difficult people 2) Insisting on knowing the salary (which is not nice)\n",
      "incidentally, i find that your video has the subtitle generating by cell phone automatically; due to curiosity, i check the consistency between the subtitles and Annie's speech and surprisingly i find that they are highly consistent. it's revealed that Annie has crystal clear, highly correct, and very fluent speech quality. that's awesome and i appreciate the way she teach.\n",

Fresh out of college as an engineer, I did great during a phone interview, but poorly in a face-to-face invterview for a fortune 500 company. I just didn't have pre-planned topics to answer some questions with and came off as unprepared and inexperienced. I didn't get the job then. 5 years later,  I wanted to redeem myself. This was a once in a lifetime job opportunity for me so I didn't want to miss my chance. I had a 30 minute interview with the executive director of engineering and was able to hit on all of my strengths clearly and concisely. I nailed it. I started by highlighting key aspects of the job posting, and then I thought about all of these interview questions and practiced my responses daily until they came out naturally.

He saw my reaction and I can tell you he was one of the kindest people I have ever encountered. He said you should see people’s reaction when I have to change tires at night.I am grateful the company gave him a job and a chance.  He turned his life around and was doing something for his kids.

They were middle  schoolers and spent the better part of the day trying to keep their pants up. But as tough as they wanted you to believe they were, most of them were just babies trying to fit in. Then I moved to a high school and stayed in touch with two who went in different directions. One is now a Highway Patrol officer. The other was murdered by his cousin at the direction of a rival gang. To this day, I feel more affection than fear for these lost souls.\n",

      "My first experience with gangs was working in a hospital and having a patient come in with severe trauma from a motorcycle accident. He looked much like this guy, tattooed from head to toe with his gang numbers and multiple scars from stabbings and gun shots. The guy didn't make it and when we called the family to tell them he was dying his mother's reply was \"he brought this upon himself with the life he was living\", no one showed up through his dying process. I ended up sitting with him after my shift was over until he passed. In the end,  I didn't care what he had done in his life I just wanted him to know someone cared for him regardless. \n",
      "My best to Baldacci, it sounds like he has people who love him and that's what matters ❤️\n",
      "It's interviews like this that remind me every day that if I'm going in with preconceived judgement about a person, I'm being an asshole. This guy is so well spoken and can tell that he can definitely put his good intentions into a powerful direction. He should take up writing so he can tell his story.\n",
      "Man he is so well spoken and I love being able to hear a different perspective on gang members and being able to see the human in all of us even through the tattoo and his past etc.\n",
      "I truly enjoyed this interview. I gave us a window to see this man soul and the work that he's doing to change his life.\n",
      "We're quick to judge people based on their looks but if we're able to get past that we can discover that this people are just human like any of us. They had little to no choice about their lifestyle but once they break the cycle I actually feel good for them.\n",
      "He’s amazingly insightful and reflective considering the life he chose and the things he’s done.  A man of paradox in so many ways.\n",

      "Thank you so much for making these videos. Your videos gave me the confidence I needed in an interview. I was so nervous to have a interview in a research management position, but your videos helped to calm me down and give me the confidence and the answers to help me get the job. I was hired on the spot. Thank you again!\n",

      "Dan Bilzerian is one of the few people that can make adam look less sleazy in comparison\n",
      "Not the biggest fan of Dan, but this was definitely the best interview he's done IMO.  You killed this Adam... You've improved an INSANE amount since the beginning days, it's nuts.\n",
      "Adam really is becoming a top tier interviewer. He was asking some great questions. I personally don't like dan that much, but I can't lie to myself and act like Dan's life isn't fascinating. Great interview.\n",
      "This was a great interview with Dan. Excellent topics and went the perfect amount of depth into each topic. I know people don't like him much, but this was a great interview with him.\n",
      "Dan's been shady and whatnot but his chemistry here with Adam resulted in an awesome conversation. Props to both.\n",

      "i could listen to her talk all day. even if it was just her reading the dictionary\n",
      "I love how she's confident enough to put forth her views about the current issues and struggles of women and how she's able to relate to and understand them and then throw light on what the world has probably been doing wrong and comment on that. All of her thoughts and ideas and opinions are so down to earth and genuine that they just touch your heart and I really appreciate her efforts of making this world a better place to live in by promoting valuable projects and regenerating the idea of gender equality amongst the youth and the older generation as well. So, good job. :)\n",
      "I was looking for \"Understanding British accent\", I am glad YouTube recommended me this. Her accent is beyond beautiful. She is intelligent too.\n",
      "I just happened to stumble upon this interview. Emma is beyond well spoken. She is highly intelligent, sweet and real. I look up to her so much. I'll always be a huge fan!\n",
      "It's awesome to see such a young woman with this effort to change the world. The hate that flows on the comments below just shows how deep her argument are going, disturbing those who feels personally offended by women with this behavior in face of life. And this is great, because this hatefull coments shows people's face, people who is hided behind a keyboard and that needs to be seen, so that the good ones can target them and avoid unreasonable discussions. Thanks, Emma!\n",
      "I’m a guy, I listened to this interview while doing bicep curls in my basement after playing rock on the drums. I’m a right leaning guy politically as well. I loved this interview. I often feel the urge to reject feminism because I feel attacked by the most extreme people that instead of wanting men in the conversation, exclude them. But Emma’s approach to Feminism is bringing guys in to the conversation to learn new lessons and recognize biases They didn’t know they had. Conversation and compromise are the two things that hold democracy together, when neither side is willing to listen or compromise nothing is achieved. When I say compromise I don’t mean Women or Men not achieving full equality. I mean that conversation is not possible without appealing to the other side. When one person yells at another, the other person stops listening and is just getting ready to yell back. Thank you Emma for being a voice of reason and compassion.\n",
      "Emma's interviews are so great and helpful in English learning🐝 she's so intelligent and just adorable! One of the best actresses of this century✨\n",
      "Her mind is so beautifully inspiring.\n",
      "Semra is absolutely brilliant. She needs to be on regularly during transfer windows. You go girl!\n",
      "Hadn’t seen an interview with her before but what quality, insight and delivery. Excellent interview Stretford!\n",
      "Semra - I'm a long time Real Madrid fan and your analysis of Casmiro's game is probably the best I've heard in 10 years - both of his strenghts and the areas one might call 'weaknesses' - it was perfect, and I would add that both Zidane and Ancellotti held him in the same high regard - I hope we don't live to regret losing him too soon.  We need you on main stream TV more...\n",
      "The channel has been getting some very good guests on recently. Well done folks.\n",
      "I agree with the Serma's comments regarding Casemiro's age, but this whole \"30 is the new 25\" is very subjective and depends on the player. Luckily, Casemiro happens to be a player that looks after himself well, and is very particular about how he trains and what he eats. His injury record is phenomenal as well. However, not every player ages like Casemiro, Modric, Ronaldo, etc. Some lack the training and nutritional ethic and often retire 1 or 2 years after 30. So, whereas it's objectively true that sports science and nutritional science in general has come a long way, that doesn't mean that every player is taking equal advantage of it (some don't even have the opportunity to do so). Players like Eden Hazard, Sergio Busquets, are good examples of the counter-narrative in my opinion. On his goals, Casemiro is really good at set pieces and his movement inside the opposition's box is very good - great aerial ability as well. All in all, Real should be glad that they didn't lose him without Tchouameni already recruited. Good luck Tank!\n",
      "Semera is a gem! Spanish football are lucky to have a pundit like her. Puts the English ones to shame\n",
      "Not only do we lack a DM, but we also lack a captain. Casemiro can fix so many of United's problems if he works out.\n",
      "If Casimero signed for Pool.or City everyone would say it's a great signing but because it's United all they just want to do is have a go.\n",
      "In Ten Hag we trust.\n",

      "Haven't seen Elon this relaxed in an interview for quite a while. Good job guys!\n",
      "Great jobs guys keeping him comfortable for 3 hours. I enjoyed this\n",
      "Can't believe Elon keeping a straight face and genuinely answering these questions. Elon is really down to earth person.\n",
      "So patient with these guys. I love how he answers the same question over and over until they all understand.\n",
      "I love Elon's laugh. For someone to be at his status to have such a relaxed demeanor and sense of humor he is hilarious\n",
      "Watching this podcast I'm thinking to myself how these guys can ask the dumbest questions with the richest and one of the smartest man in the world. Then hearing Elon's response you realize how down to earth and almost child like he is, and it dawns upon you how incredible he is in the sense that he got to this point with sheer brilliance. No fake persona, no bs, nothing like any other billionaire. He is so \"normal\" that his brilliance must surpass anyone else on this planet to get to where he is today. Respect.\n",
      "Instantly classic. Love how Elon is super intelligent but still remains down to earth to have a conversation like this... he genuinely cares about the state of humanity, more than money. GREAT WORK guys!\n",
      "I don’t why but I have the sensation that Elon is doing these kind of podcasts as another way of making bigger changes because he knows right now the majority of young people just see garbage on the internet and he being on this podcast is his way of putting his grain of salt to save humanity. What a great guy\n",
      "This was the most interesting thing I've ever watched. Questions I have myself were asked and Elon responded in a way we can all understand, even though it wouldv'e been dumbed down x10000 in his books hahaha. True legend.\n",
      "I love how literal Elon is, it's refreshing.  Interviewer when referring to mars travel:\" How many people can you fit on the Space Shuttle?\" Elon:  \"The Shuttle is not capable of going beyond earth.\"\n",

      "I see a 50 Cent interview and I watch immediately. 50 NEVER disappoints in his interviews.\n",
      "I have always loved 50 interviews. He drops knowledge like a great philosophy professor. He's always had a blueprint, a map, a plan since he first came into the game with his mixtapes. He drops gems on life, business, goals, etc. He's a marketing genius. No one can hold a candle to him when it comes to going from the bottom to the top and maintaining, while still recreating yourself and evolving as a businessman. Give this man his 🌹 roses while he's here, not after he's gone. He's one of my role models.\n",
      "That’s one of the best interviews I’ve seen recently in the hip hop space. There are so many Hip hop Podcasts now and most of them still don’t hit the way this interview hit with the amount of knowledge, business secrets & dealings, spoken in this interview! Applaud Envy & Ctgod on this piece! Respect\n",
      "50 is just a pivotal person who I repeatedly lock into throughout my life. He brings the knowledge, the hustle, the comedy, the motivation, the dominance, everything you need to hear to push further in your path\n",
      "50 knows how to lead an interview and command respect in the room. His aura and energy is just different mixed with a wealth of knowledge/intelligence. All you have to do is sit back and listen with open ears. 🙏🏾\n",
      "This is why the breakfast club is legendary. At any given moment a super legend will pull up and do a great interview.\n",
      "This made me respect 50 even more. His business acumen is so on point. I love that he's helping schools in Houston. He comes off as the bully of the block, but he's Ultimately giving people jewels and leaves it up to them to make jewelry. This man is constantly learning the business and taking over. Kudos and blessings to him.\n",
      "50 is one of the few who has truly studied the industry for years and is now reaping what he has sown. Every time he interviews he drops jewels 💎 Hate him or love him but you gotta respect him.\n",
      "50 is just a pivotal person who I repeatedly lock into throughout my life. He brings the knowledge, the hustle, the comedy, the motivation, the dominance, everything you need to hear to push further in your path\n",
      "Man, to see dudes like 50 genuinely laughing and smiling like this and to know where they came from and how hip-hop changed their lives, is really amazing. The rap game is a blessing to the black community and it makes me wonder how some of these dudes could make it and still wanna be in crime, risking their lives and their freedom, when they could be out here living their best lives like 50.\n",
      "Say what ever you want, but Boosie is the epitome of a southern raised Black man. He has real qualities and he stands on it no matter what. It doesn’t matter if you white, black, brown, don’t matter with this man. Respect him and he’s respectful back. You don’t have to agree with everything the man says, but most of what he says is the real deal facts or the hard perspectives that many people aren’t comfortable talking about. Been a huge fan of Boosie through his whole career, I wish nothing but great things for him. As a Louisiana native, it gives us hope that one day that type of success can be achieved!\n",
      "Madd respect for Boosie, this man talks common sense and self respect. Need more like this man and many more men out here in this world!!!!!\n",

      "Boosie is so passionate about what he believes in and is very outspoken. He stands on his beliefs....  I admire his truth and how he puts logic on hot topics.  You can disagree to agree but you must respect his opinion because we all have them. Keep that truth coming Boosie BADAZZ.\n",
      "Boosie needs his own talk show/ podcast!\n",
      "I really love this guy. Ain’t never listened to his music, but I can listen to him talk forever. I mean, he’s ten toes down on everything. No wavering. Boosie is the peoples champ, for real!\n",
      "Boosie is one of the realest can't go around that this man stands up for what he believes in 🐐💯\n",
      "There is no way they could quarry granite with copper tools yet alone transport the blocks 100s of miles and have the blocks fit so perfectly together.\n",
      "One thing that this is proof of is that mankind was a lot smarter and a lot more advanced than we give ourselves credit for, I’ve believe the pyramids were made by manpower and engineering my entire life. They probably didn’t quarry the stones they probably made them, and it’s very well possible to pull that stone if you but 100’s or even 1000’s if people to pull it. I also believe they used larger animals like elephants to help pull them quicker. Plus mankind was very strong and not fat and lazy like now so yea you get a bunch strong people to pull it they can I’ve seen power lifter body builders pull big rigs by themself, they probably had some kind of technique they made it be able to move and where they made the stones was probably close by\n",

      "things to respect: the length of a blade, the height of everything, the weight of everything, the ability to foresee the future.\n",
      "How the great pyramids were built?   Yeah I'm still wondering.    This show sure didn't explain how they were built.\n",
      "This isn't the big picture of history, it's applying evolutionary psychology to explain history.\n",
      "I don’t think it was “aliens”. They didn’t travel through space with advanced technology to build rock monuments. I think their would have been some metal in there.\n",
      "I defer to geologist. Geology is a true science. Archeology, not so much. Nobody can explain how they were quarried, transported and built. The fact that Egyptologists (not scientists btw) stick their story of when they were built is outrageous.\n",
      "I still kinda believe that the great pyramid in Giza was there long before the Egyptians and the other two failed Pyramids were their attempt to recreate the first one.\n",
      "I remember this. This series was interesting\n",
      "“World governments lay in ruins, major cities smolder from the attack and those who have managed to survive struggle with a sparse food supply” That’s a description of the present day lol\n",
      "If they're much more advanced technologically than us, they're most likely highly intelligent. Also, if they have the capability to get from wherever they're from to here, their ships are most likely gonna have shields or armor that can resist our weapons. Travel between the stars requires protection.\n",
      "Let's face it. An alien invasion isn't exactly \"worst-case scenario\" at this moment.\n",
      "Aliens are intelligent enough to see that our governments are doing a good enough job at destroying the world\n",
      "I believe that with few exceptions any aliens that are extremely advanced would be kind and beneficial to mankind and might only want to observe and not interfere with our development.  If they are that advanced they don't need anything we have or Earth.  They would have the intelligence to produce it themselves.\n",
      "I’m always wondering how those people immediately think we would need to fight back a species that doesn’t even showed itself yet for better or worse\n",
      "Based on the amount of energy required to travel through space, we’d have to have something of significant value and based on our communications through radio waves, such as entertainment, our intelligence wouldn’t be it.\n",
      "The most advanced \"aggressive\" alien species is less of a threat to humanity than the earthly powers in control\n",
      "Of all the multiple universes and the infinity of it all, why would we be a threat to any aliens, or better yet, why would aliens even notice our existence, especially if we are as a planet, near destruction anyway?\n",
      "This still makes the aliens too primitive and human like. More than likely they'd just turn everything off like a giant emp, and use some sort of frequency that affects our nervous system, knocking us out, then they come down to collect what they want or to take over. Is it exciting, full of action, giving the humans a chance to take a stand? No, but it's more efficient and something an advanced species would do.\n",

      "Himmlers death isn’t entirely accurate. He was detained for a short time, and although it was reported that he had died from a cyanide capsule, he was thoroughly strip searched for such an item, and during his autopsy, it was noted that he had lots of strange bruises all over his face that were not present when he had arrived. Some suspect that he was beaten to death. Historian and YouTuber “Mark Felton” researched this very subject about Himmler in a YouTube series called “The Death of Himmler” I cannot recommend his videos enough. His videos remind me of what the Military Channel once was before it became the American Hero’s Channel, if anyone remembers that.\n",

Yes, soldiers are underpaid and basically everyone that isn't an NCO or Officer lives below the poverty line Paycheck to Paycheck regardless of time in service. We had a Specialist named Kelly who was in for 20 years who had to deliver pizza's to make ends meet. Second, I can concur with the soldiers being from all walks of life. I actually served with the son of the CEO of KABAR who always got care packages from his family and gifted knives to guys on base regularly.

      "I have PTSD, and it has nothing to do with violent outbursts... It is more along the lines of being unable to stop thinking about what you saw or what happened. You keep thinking about the event, and you eventually start living your life by avoiding anything that might remind you of what happened, to get it to stop replaying in your head, this can be at all different levels, from avoiding certain types of people, to avoiding groups, public transportation, or in some cases, avoiding people altogether. Violence can be a normal response to many stressful situations, but most people with PTSD aren't violent, if anything, most people go out of our way to avoid violence or confrontation. I guess the stereotype arises when people turn to drugs, and especially alcohol to help them stop thinking about what happened, and the alcohol is what causes the violent outbursts.  The idea of someone mistaking you as some enemy and attacking you is a myth, at least, I've never met anyone like that or experienced anything like that, you don't have real flashbacks like hallucinations, you just can not stop thinking about what happened, why it happened, how you could have stopped it, and etc, like anyone in a traumatic event, issue is usually, it goes away after a bit, where in PTSD, you still keep dwelling on it years later.\n",

      "As a Marine with 7 years of service, I can say that hazing 100% exists and is an integral part of Marine Corps basic training. Full Metal Jacket was the most accurate representation, but it’s more than that. Also, you don’t shoot unless it’s to kill. Not to disarm, not to scare, but to kill. And if you’re with anyone that’s afraid to do so, you can’t trust them to have your back.\n",
      "my great uncle served 2 tours in Vietnam as a medical huey pilot, he came back with PTSD and his episodes are usually panicking or scans the room, he only got violent once when a burglar triggered him when he pulled a knife on my great aunt, the guy is currently still recovering in the hospital 3 months later\n",

      "I grew up in the shadow of Cahokia and it has been extremely influential in my appreciation and reverence for all peoples. In college we excavated a game processing camp many miles from Cahokia and the enormity of the resources needed to feed their rapidly expanding population was an incredible story all on its own. I appreciate how thoughtful and well made this documentary is and hope more will be coming in the near future.\n",
      "There are a lot of unique aspects to this video that I really enjoyed, the small sample of languages, even the hunting reenactments.  Native American cultures are so interesting and diverse, they’re just endlessly fascinating.  I hope the native languages will always be preserved, there’s always resistance by children, especially teenagers, to adopt the more conservative aspects of their parents’ culture.  I remember listening to a Navajo radio station near Window Rock, AZ, and when the “required” traditional song was finished, the young DJ said “that’s enough of that (bleep), the tribe makes us play these!”, then put the latest rock back on.  This is universal, not specific to any cultures, kids around the world always want what’s new!   When they eventually have children of their own, they’re glad they received the traditional culture and want to pass it on.\n",
      "What an amazing story is being uncovered and told!  So many generations, so many lives, so many experiences!  We owe a great deal to those that came before us and should pass on the best of what we have learned to those who will follow!

Due to the ice sheets the ocean could have meant more southern paths leading to Southern North America and South America settlement.  The Solutreans could have come across the Atlantic south of those glaciers into East North America.  Then all groups could have spread across the continents and mixed.\n",
      "Actually the ancient native American used large hunting tools. The mammoth and large animals thousands of years later the native Americans use smaller size spears, bows and arrows. Many different tribes lived in other places. The Ojibwe once lived in far eastern Canada and the Navaho came from western Canada.

      "An interesting footnote from history. After the conference in Tehran in 1943, it was decided that the Allies would start delivering aid to the Yugoslav partisans and that aid to the Yugoslav monarchists would be stopped. When, after the conference, one of the British members of the delegation told Churchill that he had sold Yugoslavia to the communists, Churchill asked him: \"will you live in Yugoslavia after the war?\" The delegate replied that he wouldn't, to which Churchill added: \"I won't either, so why bother?\"\n",

      "My grandmother was born in 1944. She was the youngest of five children. The village where she was born was located in communist controlled territory, so the EAM/ELAS forces would regularly interrogate locals in case of any anti-communist activity. Her father decided it was best to stay neutral and simply co-operate with the communists. Then some guy in the village who had some dispute with him framed him for anti-communist activity. The whole family (my grandmother being just a few months old) was transported to a prison camp set up by the EAM/ELAS for anyone accused of opposing them. There, they rounded up all the men and executed them. My great-grandfather was beheaded with an axe and his body was thrown into a well. Soon, the prisoners were liberated and they returned to their homes. My grandmother grew up without a father, something which still deeply affects her to this day. Because of that, she simply dismisses anything remotely left-wing because of all the trauma caused by EAM/ELAS. The Greek Civil War is one of the darkest pages in Greek history, and you can still see how it has divided us.\n",

This dictated the amount of geopolitical influence the Soviets and the British had over Greece in the post-war period, which defined Greece as chiefly British in influence. That lead to Greek communist pleas to Moscow falling on deaf ears. That contributed to a divide in the KKE, whether to be Titoist or Stalinist, which was important to understand their aims and how that inhibited the movement\n",

      "Very good story on how lead emissions from automobiles have effected humanity. But even heavier amounts of lead possibly 10,000 times higher were in the average household during that same time period. Most paints contained extremely high levels of lead, many millions of infants would have set their teeth grinding away at the paintwork on the side of their crib. Not to mention most of their metal toys were liberally coated with lead paint. Plumbers used a combination of red lead paint and hemp as thread sealer for household water pipes. Most pencils had a high lead concentration, hence the phrase get some lead in your pencil. House roofing had lead flashing and many homes had a rain water collection tank for drinking water. I could go on and on so my argument is that the regular household was probably a bigger contributor to the lead poisoning of the people than just the automobile. Solder usually 60/40 lead - tin combination also heavily used in household plumbing as well as electrical and electronic equipment. So you can see the averages home of that same era had copious amounts of lead levels. To blame the the automobile totally for the spike in lead poisoning would be a seriously biased view.\n",

In the latter you get an axe to the skull, sword to the gullet, mace to the brain and other physically distressing items. The Vikings were essentially very motivated buyers.\n",

      "I love your videos! I think you would be intrigued  to hear or perhaps you are already aware  that there is an ancient  record that was unearthed in the 1820's in Palmyra,  New York that was inscribed  in reformed Egyptian by ancient  Israelites. They crossed over the seas from Jerusalem around 600 BC and landed on what they described to be  a narrow neck of land (most likely in Panama). They left their records behind for us and their records spoke of Jesus Christ visiting them after his resurrection.  They multiplied their seed and spread North and South and fought many battles over the  North and South American continents which were considered their new \"Promised land\".  Thus the signs of Christ written with Hebrew origin that you examined would be accurate. There is another record which has been discovered in Panama much like the one discovered in Palmyra, New York. It is a gold set of plates with ancient Egyptian and Hebrew origins as well. Perhaps you could examin the Panama gold plates to see if they are authentic?\n",

      "So there's been some conversations here about my use of the term 'Viking' and who it refers to. I think it's important to start off by saying that these videos aren't made for university-level history buffs or the like. They're designed for people trying to learn about historical periods they know little about or are revising for exams (A-Levels, GCSEs etc.). Since I base my videos (where applicable) on British teaching standards I think it's important to note that that the use of the term 'Viking' and 'Scandinavian' are allowed to be used interchangeably at this level. At the level of a Bachelor or Masters degree, absolutely not. That level of historical nuance isn't required here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, the technicalities of historical analysis demand that certain terms be used only under specific circumstances. But not here. These videos aren't for in-depth historical analysis nor do they claim to be a definitive history of the Viking Age.  The people commenting that 'Viking' was not used accurately are largely correct. However, in the context of who this video is for, it matters more that other information is included and those watching not be bogged down by technicalities. These videos are here to build a foundation from which people can research further. There are other channels if you'd like in-depth and dry discussions of terminology.\n",

After several minutes of punching that button, I discovered that it had worked perfectly! The radio and the cd were both playing Beethovens' 9th!

      "My grandmother was a teenager living on a farm with her mother and father during these times in Dongguan (which has been the electronics manufacturer of the world for the past 10 years) in the Guangdong Province. Her father died rather abruptly from inhaling toxic gases while clearing a crude drainage system on the farm and left my grandmother and her mother behind. She says that before her farm was confiscated by the CCP (her mother was actually compensated the equivalent of pennies on the dollar of what the farmland was worth, but they really didn't have a choice in the matter) there would always be 'distant relatives' and strangers that would stay on their farm and freeload because they had nowhere else to go, had no money and were starving. My grandmothers mother was kind hearted and took in these less fortunate people as best as her means could provide. At some point she housed and fed more than 15~20 of them. For many of them it was a sojourn whilst making their way down to Hong Kong which was free from the troubles of China at the time. Many had heard of the prosperity that the British Colony had brought and wanted a piece of the pie. \n",
      "Some years later even my wifes father had swam across the seas to illegally enter Hong Kong when the Government at the time announced they were issuing ID Cards for citizenship. Albeit, his heart still belongs to China as the indoctrination that generation was subject to, to them was really profound. He would often complain to his children \"why do all of you not love China?!\" and they would retort \"if you love China so much what are you doing in Hong Kong?\" to which he would become frustrated for having no good answer.\n",

      "Thutmose III was a child when his father, Thutmose II died in 1479 BC. His stepmother and aunt Hatshepsut became regent during his minority but was herself declared pharaoh within a couple of years. Although Thutmose III was not deposed, he would remain powerless during Hatshepsut's reign. In theory he and his stepmother were co-rulers, but in practice his position was nebulous and he was kept out of the way as Hatshepsut ruled Egypt. Thutmose III was also married to Hatshepsut's daughter to further consolidate his claim to the throne. Its believed that Thutmose III resented Hatshepsut for sidelining him in the first 22 years of his reign, and after Hatshepsut died indulged himself in a bit spite that was aimed at his stepmother when he tore down her statues and removed her images from temples and other important structures.\n",

All the while Egypt under Hatshepsut experienced a period of growth and security, which the nation needed. Trade routes were re-established and the economy grew by leaps and bounds.

      "1. Tennessee prisoners were NOT sent to Birmingham. They were leased to Tennessee Coal and Railroad Company (it's a little more complicated than that, but we can go with that for simplicity's sake) who used prisoners in their mines in Tennessee. After convict leasing ended in Tennessee in 1896, Tennessee Coal and Railroad moved its headquarters to Birmingham and continued using forced prison labor there, but those were Alabama prisoners, NOT Tennessee prisoners. \n",
      "2. States absolutely used convict leasing to make money. The lease on the Tennessee State Penitentiary could not be sold for less than $100,000 PER YEAR beginning in the mid-1880s. That would be over $2 million per year in today's money. \n",
      "3. Selling crops after sunset was specifically illegal as a means of controlling sharecroppers. The idea was that sharecroppers might sell some of their crop outside of their contract with the landowner.

      "It is important to understand that in Goethe's time there was a 'Romantic movement'; nothing to do with the definition of the word today, but rather as best described as the counter enlightenment. Goethe was an early proponent of its ideas and was part of a group in the late 18th C called 'Sturm und Drang' (Storm and Stress), a small group including Schiller, of 'angry young men' who embraced the Ideals of the Romantic movement.\n",

      "The Romantics were not an organised group as such. One of the best descriptions of (the Romantics) was written by my old Philosophy teacher - \"The declared aim of the romantics was to tear down the artifices of 'culture' and 'rationality' which barred the way, both historically and personally, to a \"return to nature\": this is nature the unbounded, wild and ever-changing, nature the sublime and powerful. Were humans to behave 'Naturally', freed from the artificial constraints of cultural convention and morality, then it was proposed that the truth of human life would be revealed, and humans could live a nobler life. In the name of nature, the romantics worshipped: liberty, power, love, violence, imagination, irrationality, the Greeks, the 'primitives' or anything that aroused their emotional responses, while in actuality they worshipped emotions as an end in themselves.\"\n",

Like, when the teacher explains the deep meaning of something, it makes total sense and logic to get to that point of analytical conclusion. But, when I try to find a meaning of something, it always turns out to be wrong even though there’s technically no correct way to analyze a text perfectly. It just doesn’t make sense to me when I would get a 75 on a analysis paper just because the teacher didn’t see/analyze what I wrote about a certain text.\n",
      "This is why I pretty much lost a significant focus on writing and critical analysis. Much of the following is due to bad memory, but, everything I would say and write as my own point of view on the understanding of a character's situation, I would \"get it wrong\". Maybe I needed to grow up from such a sheltered environment and know first hand what the characters in the novels, essays, were going through. I was only a kid.\n",

Also start with classical short stories like a 20th century author for me are a way easier than ancient authors. Another thing you can do is let the text flows naturally, when i read the scarlet letter it was hard for some words but as long as you know the context or what is happening is fine.💗\n",

      " way back!\n",

      " fast the time goes by.... How much of it do we really spend seriously \n",
      "thinking about our lives? Very little indeed... Because it requires a \n",
      "certain level of focus and depth, which we don't have most of the time.\n",
      "That's why this scene is a great reminder. \n",
      "\n",

I understand that this is just a 10-minute video and you are just trying to give people a vague idea and a taste of the book, but the way you made it out in your video it may seem like War And Peace is just about Natasha, but the whole point of the book is that it is a huge, epic story, with so many characters whose lives are all intertwined.\n",
      "His life is so wholesome and laddish at the same time, from being a drunk gambling layabout pestering gypsy women then getting bored and becoming an officer to penning literary masterpieces about inner kindness and understanding then just walking out on your family and dying of pneumonia. Absolute madman\n",
      "My all time favorite writer. An entire School of Life episode could be dedicated to Tolstoy's short stories. Strider - God Sees the Truth, but Waits - What Men Live By - Master And Man - The Wood Felling - Sevastopol... I've read all those stories 50 times, and hope to read them 50 more. James Joyce once said that Tolstoy's How Much Land Does A Man Need is the greatest short story ever written.\n",

I've loved it for as long as i can remember. however, i grew up dirt poor and seeing the way  my parents, who both worked day and night, struggled to provide for us and meet ends meet gives me a pretty innate fear of falling into poverty as an adult. i want to provide for my parents and i want to be able to provide abundously for a kid if i had one. i am lucky enough to have received grants for college, and as much as ait hurts, i don't intend to waste it on a major like English. that's kinda just how it is. wish the world was different. not everybody has that luxury.\n",
      "this video arrived at the most opportune moment!!  i started off college (i'm currently a sophomore) with studying biochem and holy hell was it torture. before starting college, i thought i really liked science and it is what my parents dreamed for me to study, even most of my cousins have studied something stem (science, tech, engineering, and math) related. while i did ok in my first semesters, i felt REALLY depressed and suffocated. my mental health was at its lowest, it was a terrible time for me. i realized i did not like what i was studying at all and the pressure i felt from my family made it much worse. a week ago, i talked with my academic advisor and we discussed about changing majors, from biochem to english. let me tell you, i breathed a sigh of relief and almost broke down in front of her when i was able to switch to an english major.\n",

      "Charles Dickens had what is called the \"Beatles factor.\" His writing could appeal to both the smartest and the dumbest person in the room. Like the music of The Beatles.\n",
      "I don't think that Dickens' shortcomings as a husband and parent were a result of the difficulty of being great at two things at the same time but rather is an example of how difficult it is to overcome the emotional, spiritual, and psychic damages inflicted by an unhappy childhood. While he was able to turn his pain and suffering into art, quite an achievement, he wasn't able to heal emotionally. It's usually easier to deal with such things in abstract, intellectual and artistic ways. He was in many ways driven by his demons, and that can, surprisingly, take you very far in life, but it doesn't make you a better person. In fact, the success may militate against real change.\n",

      "Dickens's genius was in bringing characters, and physical objects to life. He was not being \"seductive\" he was making us relive his experience and making  people and places come to life. No one will ever forget Miss Havisham's wedding cake, the character of Bill Sykes, or Mr Micawber. Once you encounter the scenes and objects and characters of his novels you never forget them.\n",
      "It really made me sad that this person was so great and dedicated in his work but at the same time at the expense of terrible relations with his wife and 10 children…it’s just so freaking sad. You can never have it all, can you?\n",

      "Funny. I had an English undergrad friend who would read books in one or two days, while it took me weeks to finish the same book. I once asked him how he did it and he replied: \"Don't think too much. Just let the book take you away. If you feel like coming back to it for a deeper reading, that's when you'll read slowly and with a more analytical eye. But not every book will be worth it. And sometimes you might not be ready for a deeper run through it, so no point in forcing it.\"\n",
      "I kinda get it, because when I was learning English I would read books in English without understanding most of it.

      "Seneca suggested to his friends that instead of reading ever more widely, we ought to focus on the works and authors that really inspire us.  Most readers don't do this so their thinking tends to be dominated by the last few things they've read and they end up struggling with all these conflicting truths living inside them.  Seneca thought our time was better spent developing a deep understanding of ideas that are truly important to us rather than surveying a wide range of opinions without deep contemplation and reflection.  And in addition to the chance to read a book with a different purpose, re-reading is worthwhile because while the book stays the same, if you pick it up again after a few years, you're a different person and that allows you to see it in a new way.\n",

      "Recently I read The Iliad, a book that I had given up once before, and which I knew near to nothing about. I skipped the introduction, which was rich in detail that would spoil the book and started reading it. I was initially constrained by the idea that it was a \"difficult book\", but over time, with some paced reading, I found myself really curious about what would happen next. I knew of course that I was doing a \"light reading\" of an overly analyzed book and that I would miss a lot of detail. But I still enjoyed it and after finishing it I went back to read the introduction and found it _incredible_, since it made me think critically about things I had read or notice stuff I missed. As a bonus, it also gave me desire to read it again!\n",

It took me three or four goes to get through it first time round, but every time I started from the beginning again, I was finding new stuff in it I hadn't noticed before - and in the end taught myself enough German to be able to tackle it in the original.

Coherence and transition that will support why your doing a specific study is more important, moreover sufficient. If you see an underlying pattern in terms of method or conclusion lets say among 3-5 studies, try to explain this pattern in 1 paragraph. You dont need to write how those authors got the results in detail, unless you see a clash between two papers, then maybe you can re-evaluate their differences in method.\n",

But the modern students who I teach (there are 500 on my university of York dissertation module), are faced and burdened with limitless access to knowledge, and the fields of literature become endless. The student has to navigate a constant tension between chaos and order. I find examples help, so students can see the limits and horizons before them.

      "- Biographical silence favours Shakespeare (about whom we know relatively little) than Milton, whose remarkable life positions him uniquely to speak on matters of loss, weakness, aspiration, perseverance, hatred, and love. This was hardly raised.\n",
      "- So too historical context: Shakespeare comes clearly out of an Elizabethan tradition laid out in part for him by writers like Marlowe and co-developed by writers like Jonson; Milton obliterates the norms of mid-17th century poetry with a literary iconoclasm surpassed only by his republicanism.\n",
      "- Drama favours interiority, and interiority here was presented as the sine qua non of literary greatness. Milton and most literary history would not have thought it so; though the actors brilliantly depicted M's dramatic imagination in Paradise Lost, his goal, unlike Shakespeare's was not primarily to explore the contours of the human mind, but to go beyond them. His theme is not finally the human, but the human-in-the-cosmos.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, we judged here whether Milton was better according to the criteria of Shakespeare. Shakespeare will win that battle with anyone. Milton will sooner decline your crown and force you to ask whether you're asking the right questions in the first place.\n",
      "Harriet Walter embodies so perfectly Lady Macbeth that it's shocking at sight. Bravo!\n",
      "Imagine the RSC, with all its talented actors, producing an audio-book recording/dramatisation of Paradise Lost. Oh, bliss!\n",
      "A very important thing is left out I think. Shakespeare was aiming for a wide range of accessibility so that he could pay his bills. He wrote for the ignorant barbarous \"ground- ling\" and for the intellectual as well.

If you reject them, it could spell doom for you, or your loved ones. Horny gods punishing mortals for denying them sex is a recurring theme throughout Classical Mythology.\n",
      "The Odyssey is Homer un-writing the Iliad. When Odysseus raids, cheats, and behaves generally like a Iliadic hero he is at his weakest (and at the beginning of his odyssey). By the end he refuses to cheat on his wife with the incredible fantastic Nausica, he shows almost inhuman patience and self-control in the face of the suitors' abuse, and he choses nostos over kleos, the choice Achilles couldn't stand to make. What's more, Achilles himself discredits the entire premise of the Iliad when Odysseus sees him down in the land of the dead, by saying that \"it is better to be the lowest slave than king among all the unnumbered dead.\"\n",

      "\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\" truly is one of the best books I've read so far in 50 years of reading experience. Reminds me to read it again sometime in the near future...\n",
      "Pedro Páramo by the Mexican writer Juan Rulfo is one of the masterpieces of Latin American literature, it is considered the novel that inaugurated the literary subgenre of \"Magical Realism in Latin America\".\n",
      "Juan Rulfo's work finally gave me the path I was looking for to continue with my books,” Colombian Nobel laureate Gabriel García Márquez confessed in an interview.\n",
      "Magical realism is not from Colombia because the term is European in concoction. However, when European writers viewed the way Latin American writers wrote they saw it as realism with a splash of \"magical\". They viewed these stories through a lens of exotification, without realising that it's ALL real and that it's a description of the absurdities found in Latin American societies. If we think about what exotification is, it's about seeing what's mundane or normalized in one society and treating it as special or unique because one is not used to it. It's very much about ignorance and how what we don't understand can often appear magical. As a result, how these authors chose to tell the story is what mattered. This is why magical realism, in my opinion, does not exist. It's a term created in ignorance and perhaps the literary term itself is the most magical part about the whole genre.\n",
      "I read a magical realism text for the first time in a magazine. It told the story of three dragons who were adopted by a couple. they raised them as if they were human. The way the author narrated the passage of their age, in childhood, adolescence and even adulthood is comical and fantastic at the same time. Dragons fight, mess, do drugs, get married, divorce and die.\n",
      "You forgot the most important and influential book of Latin American Magical Realism, the corner stone: Pedro Paramo by Mexican Juan Rulfo. Latin American writers influenced Salman Rushdie, et al. BTW, Garcia Marquez is a Nobel Prize laureate.\n",
      "I thoroughly enjoyed this and I'm glad I already had a solid enough concept of Magical Realism; yet this made me aware that culturally it made such a political impact. My debut book \"Just a Little Broken\" I like to think is in the same vein as the genre. It allows a significant amount of freedom in storytelling, especially within a reality-based land. I appreciate all the information and nuances packed into these videos.\n",

      "I saw  no reason ever to bother to  read   magical realism  novels..😁😉\n",
      "Excellent explanation. I completely agree with your explanation of magic realism and also the idea that it is a post colonial resistance against Eurocentrism, but I think its scope is even bigger. One aspect of magic realism is politically ideological, that is the postcolonial stuff. Another aspect is challenging the constricted mentality created by strict adherence to materialistic/scientific determinism. This aspect is more philosophical, and not just ethical like the ideological aspect but also epistemological or maybe even metaphysical i.e. it may draw our attention to fundamental questions about the nature of reality and the likes. This is just my personal opinion.\n",

      "Definition: A critical recap of what has already been researched on a topic\n",
      "\n",
      "Why do a literature review?\n",
      "1. To find out for yourself what's already known about the topic\n",
      "2. To give your reader a critical overview of what you found\n",
      "3. To find out what's missing (gaps)\n",

      "As a student of literature, I fully agree with what you're saying in this video. I almost use the same exact same arguments when someone asks me why I study literature lol \n",
      "I love how you and your mum discuss literature so casually and playfully, that's some real family goals right there\n",
      "Why I read and what book I read depends on my mood or my aims. Sometimes I read for a bit of escapism. Other times it’s to learn. Sometimes it’s both. I love it when a book teaches you something that you never realised or expected, and it stays with you and even changes your way of thinking.\n",
      "Emma, you have the best non-book channel book channel on YT!\n",
      "I think it's down to your mindset. There are some truly trash novels in existence, but you can read something like Normal People and take something away from it, like what your mum said about her crime novels. If you have a philosophical/analytical/learning mindset then any book or even trash reality shows can be good places to apply and challenge your thoughts about other people and contemporary society.\n",
      "\n",
      "A literature degree is a good place to \"learn to learn\" and really develop that analytical mindset and how to write essays, but this can be accomplished through so many other degrees also.\n",
      "“I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound or stab us. If the book we're reading doesn't wake us up with a blow to the head, what are we reading for? So that it will make us happy, as you write? Good Lord, we would be happy precisely if we had no books, and the kind of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we had to. But we need books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us. That is my belief.” \n",
      "This quote by Kafka perfectly illustrates why we need books to challenge and disrupt us cerebrally. If we’re reading only for entertainment, where else in our lives are we finding that sector of learning and stimulation that phenomenal books provide us with?\n",
      "I had forgotten about what it feels like reading a good book, since it's been awhile- I haven't taken a English class this semester. But your thoughts made me remember. All the reasons you talked about reinvigorates my curiosity to think about the human experience, question the beliefs/mindsets I currently have, and, well, to study literature!\n",
      "I read mostly non fiction books on random topics that interest me. Currently  reading a book on artists and architects. Since lockdown been watching a lot of documentaries on artists and galleries. So I got a book on the topic unfortunately it’s about 700 pages. Which almost put me off but out of pride I couldn’t give up. Only to become fascinated by how all these buildings that were built for people, are no longer there. So who do these objects serve? This book was written in 2017 with an international look as  these creators (to encapsulate both artists and architects). In a series of interviews have to explain their method. Some are coy but those willing to share open up this view of how they see the world in relation to the notion of space. If I understood correctly each creator seeks to capture and reflect this moment in time for future generations to understand their time.\n",
      "When you read a novel, how much do you focus on the text vs the background of the author? For instance, one of my favorite books is The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov. If you read it by itself, it is such an interesting novel, however, learning the history of its writing in the background of Stalin's Russia makes it even more interesting. How much time should we dedicate to looking beyond the four corners, if at all?\n",
      "I usually pick up a book for two reasons, either because I like to see what it would be like to live in a different reality (and that is why I read a lot of fantasy and horror) or because I want to know how it is like to live and think as a certain person or in a certain place and time (for that is when I go to classics and more international literature). Also I totally agree with the \"people should read classics\" thing, it's so cool when you read a classic and finally get this book that keeps being referenced everywhere and you understand why that book has been read for generations.\n",

      "The literature review is not an essay, it is not a research paper - the literature review is part of your essay, the literature review is part of your research paper or maybe stand-alone product if you're master's degree or doctoral degree program and you have to do that for. But regardless of whether part of the research essay or stand-alone product, one thing the literature review does not do is - It doesn’t prove, state, illustrate, collaborate or develop your main point, that's in the body of your essay. The literature review does not do that it does not provide the body or development section up your affect or your paper. Well, what the heck does it do then?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, the literature review is divided into the following key terms: first is, the whole idea of what the heck in the literature? The literature is simply those major works that have been published about your narrow topic. Now remember I said narrow topic, we are not going to be reviewing every published thing on a broad topic like steroid use by athletes, you could have a more narrow topic like steroid use by high school affiliates or steroid use by baseball players into you going to be reviewing the major works just on that narrow topic, that's the first thing that you need to know. The literature is published, peer reviewed sources on in narrow topic. Second thing, the literature review is that narrow topic in all those sources published on it are going to be reviewed. What the heck of a review, well review is simply a way of looking at something in taking a snapshot of it. What is that snapshot going to capture? That snapshot going to capture major concepts, the major point, the major outcome, the major whatever in that source. It’s not going to be a detailed write up of that source going to be a snapshot. Once you get all those snapshot done, you going to show the relationship between those snapshot and talking about those relationships you probably going to be pulling them in some kind of time-line situation, maybe not, but the key years is you’re going to be extracting just the major element in then relationship among those major element, may be on a time line type of situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the next thing to know about them going to reviewers why they're hack are you doing all this stuff. Well, I think there are three reasons, probably, why you're doing all this stuffs in school. In the first one, off course, to improve your own understanding, as an undergraduate researcher coming into these topics  into this discipline on the undergraduate level when the first link to you have to do is to build your understanding, build your background, build your expertise in a particular discipline in subject in that discipline. Then in of course in this paper, when you have built your expertise in your knowledge in this particular subject you're going to be demonstrating that knowledge, demonstrating that expertise to your professor because this is a college assignment. But you know, the real purpose of a literature review is, it’s a reader service, it something you doing as a favor for your readers, what are you doing you are bringing them up to date.\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s the first thing you and that old friend do? You ask each other- hey what you been doing all these years? Fill me in, update me, you doing the same thing in a literature review you feeling them in, you updating them. By bringing them up to date, then you can start at the present again.  You see what I’m saying, you can bring them along that time-line of the path, letting them know the key element, the major concepts, the key element in your life and what you dare? Boom then you can start and that the dividing line between the literature's review in the rest of your paper the development you go all their ideas, past scholars, the past researchers boom and then come your idea.\n",

      " My understanding is it's part of a basket of stocks all shorted with the same instrument (and all retail companies. Movie theatre, used game store, towels) and when GME went parabolic the covering that occurred on that single security pushed up the whole basket. I can't talk for other investors but very little of the rest of the basket was mentioned on Reddit prior to the last week of Jan 21. \n",
      "Sure, since becoming bagholders people think it's a movement but to start with it was a value play. When I went long gme was $9.18 pre split with $12 book value. When I went long bbby it was $4.98 with huge call option interest at $5 and Ryan Cohen had skin in the game. \n",

      "I think more than anything the meme stock phenomenon is a protest against the vitriol exhibited towards the retail investor. With that said, I do and like having a small portion of my portfolio reserved for speculation, having made some good money off of picks like AMC and BBBY. It’s small enough where it doesn’t hurt my long term investment goals and strategy, and large enough to “have fun” with. As long as you don’t put more down than you’re willing to lose and fully acknowledge it’s a casino, have fun with it. Just be safe, set your stop limits, and take profit as you go. (Not financial advice, just how I conduct myself)\n",

      "Nice beds.  If you like the bed sheets to look crisp, like they were just ironed, make the bed and then lightly mist spray the sheets (including the pillowcases) with plain water, using a standard spray bottle.  This works on cotton sheets, which will stretch out as the mist of water dries out.  It is a luxury hotel trick.  The sheets will look pristine, especially white sheets.\n",
      "I LOVE this descriptive talk-through format of the video. For us less design-inclined mortals, it is incredibly insightful to hear your breakdown of the reasoning and choices! :)\n",
      "Oh Drew! I loved all of these stylings, but felt that the 3rd one just tied in all of the colors of your room, especially the dark paneling. And the 4th one added a soft warmth & great texture. Would you PLEASE do a similar video for window treatments? Styling different curtains patterns & colors,  with the rods, etc? I would love to see all the different ways you would style a window😍.\n",

Also love the attention to detail with the airplane cups! :) Thanks so much for the relaxation and content you provide for us <3\n",

All these soft relaxing sounds were so good 😌, I especially enjoyed the plush watermelon borrowed from Satine, the small brush, and all the whispering of course! Thank you Gibi 😊.\n",

      "The fact that the windows get darker progressively is a sign of how attentive to detail Latte is. Amazing work!\n",
      "Latte, would you ever consider doing a behind the scenes of your ASMR filming process? I am so fascinated by how detailed your sets are, how perfect you make them, and how you embody every aspect of the role you’re playing for these ASMR videos. It’s incredible! I’d love to see a behind the scenes of you setting up and filming! I think many others would, too! 😍❤️🥰\n",
      "latte is so incredible. i am a teen and struggle with anxiety, depression, ocd, adhd, paranoia, body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria, ptsd, and dissociative issues as well as chronic pain, so it is usually very difficult for me to feel relaxed and fall asleep. i discovered latte two years ago and it changed my life. she is so soothing and comforting without being condescending, annoying, or repetitive and her videos are always incredibly high quality. i’ve watched all of her videos (including the ones in languages i don’t understand) and there wasn’t a single video i didn’t like. i love and appreciate latte so much <33\n",

      "I, and hopefully other people, would love to see a “behind the scene” of the making on of these videos!!!\n",
      "This woman is one of the few asmr tists who got exactly the concept and mastered the practice. Some asmrtists, as fine as they are, do not have the sensibility to sometimes avoid some triggers or noises that can actually bother the most sensitive listeners. There are patterns of sounds, which means some sounds will cause relaxation, other sounds might bother one same person and many youtubers don't realize that these cannot be mixed. Me, for an example, hate very high pitched noises, hate plastic and eating sounds. Latte could never have a disturbing plastic noise on her videos. She just knows what's up.\n",
      "Whenever you tell us to breathe in and breathe out it INSTANTLY relaxes me. You are the only ASMR person that has given me complete relaxation in such a simple manner. Your voice is just perfect for this....\n",

      "I'm Chinese-Australian, and I started thinking about what my ideal comfort food would be when I started watching this video. It turned out that I had a very similar experience with the Chinese lady in this video as well. My parents sometimes made congee with cabbage and chicken in the morning and it was the best meal I could ever have wanted. I also requested this when I was sick and also when I got braces on (because I could only eat soft foods). It really shows just how nice this mixture of rice and water really is.\n",
      "My comfort food is maggi..being an indian I literally grew up eating it..you can just eat it anytime..every indian loves it\n",
      "I'm Filipino and my favorite comfort food is called Bananacue, It's basically Banana covered with crunchy caramel but typically we don't use just normal Bananas, we use a kind of Banana called Sabah and its like Banana but bigger and a little bit firmer. Typically served on a stick but it's up to you on how you want it served.\n",
      "I’m Mongol  and my favorite comfort food is the blood of my enemies.\n",
      "I'm polish and my comfort food is \"pierogi ruskie\".\n",
      "It's dumplings with potato, cheese and garlic filling, boiled and then fried in bacon fat with crispy bits of bacon and sometimes caramelized onion sprinkled on top, with a bit of butter for that extra creamy taste.\n",
      "I can eat them by kilograms!\n",
      "I don't know why everyone is disliking the British one, for me I think comfort foods means that you can have it all the time whether you're happy, sad, tired exhausted or energetic. Personally, I don't even like bread and toast but for him it might be his comfort food which he can have it all the time whenever he wants to, without even thinking about the preparations to make for a grand food. xx\n",
      "Being British the best comfort food is at Chinese takeaway their bbq sweet ribs are PERFECT they fall off the bone and you get to eat the sweet crunchy cartilage (and if  you like it the bone marrow) it’s perfect to eat and the sauce in the tub left over in thick and sweet and perfect for the chips they sell that are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Hope I described it well\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: ALSO MARMITE AND CHEESE INBETWEEN 2 PIECES OF TOAST JUST JJEJJSJSJSJSJJSSJISISJENJD\n",
      "A fellow Mexican here and I have two different comfort foods. For when I want something sweet I go with arroz con leche because its good for any time of the day and can be eaten cold or hot which means it's good for literally any time of the year. And my other comfort food is definitely pozole it is just so good and warm and it gives me memories of all the parties I went to when I was a child.\n",

      "As a native Chicagoan I can safely say Portillos is pretty great. The Italian beef and their crinkle fries are both so so good! However as someone who visits Missouri yearly you can never say no to Lions Choice. It puts Arbys to shame with real roast beef, gotta get it with Swiss and au jus with a fountain IBC root beer! It doesn’t get much better than that!\n",

      "As a Native Idahoan, I can attest to the fact that Boise Fry Company is AMAZING!!! They have a buffalo burger that is divine and I prefer the purple, yam, or sweet potato with Fry sauce and blueberry ketchup.\n",
      "I was born and raised in Anchorage, and I can all but guarantee you that while Tommy's is at-best pretty standard, it's an absolute tourist trap and has been since I was born (in 1993). Go to Long Branch Saloon for burgers, and if you want a more \"Alaskan experience\" try to go for a salmon quesadilla from Salmon Express during Saturday Market. My recommendation is to order it spicy but even getting a regular is going to be excellent even if you're not big on seafood.\n",
      "Went to North Carolina for my cousin's wedding back in October 2018. Mentioned that we were going to go to Bojangles the following day.

One awesome thing about the USA being so big and so diverse is that you can find literally every type of cuisine there, both genuine and Americanized.\n",

Seriously though, if you come to MD in the summer, go to Cantlers or Mike's crab house near the bay bridge, you wont be dissapointed\n",
      "As someone who grew up in New Jersey, I do love salt water taffy.  But sub sandwiches are the real iconic food from NJ.  The term \"submarine sandwich\" was coined in my hometown of Paterson by an Italian immigrant (thanks Wikipedia).  White House Subs in Atlantic City is one of the Jersey Shore's oldest sub shops, and of course the Jersey Mike's chain started from in Pt. Pleasant.   (Yes, your local deli probably makes a better sandwich. But JM's subs are at least far superior to Subway...)\n",

It doesn't look bad, but probably something you'd find more on the coast (specifically Charleston) than inner state.

They have a bigger menu compared to North and East.\n",

      "There are actually 2 extremely different McDonald’s menu’s in India I am from north India and over there most of the things are different from the menu shown in the video\n",
      "Edit: the comments are actually telling me that there are two official distributors of McDonald’s in India and because of that the menu’s vary drastically which is pretty interesting actually and you guys could do a food wars season/spin off showing the regional differences between fast food chains in India itself\n",
      "Nikhil is genuinely the best person to represent Indian food on global media. He knows his shit and how to accurately talk about India's various socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds.\n",

      "Domino's India used to do twisties (twistie bread - they used to be these long braided dough with garlic butter and oregano seasoning brushed on top) long time back. They were an off menu item and the cheapest thing at Domino's. These teiesties were decentralized and being a broke college student, the twisties helped me a lot!\n",
      "I love how brutal the commentary is in this one. It's about time somebody puts Dominos in its place. I never really understood why people like them so much, but to each their own, I guess. It's just too bad they have no appreciation on what qualifies as food worth paying for.\n",
      " \n",
      "BTW, Nikhil is so funny. I hope you have him on more often.\n",
      "I have wanted to visit India forever to experience authentic Indian food. It’s my favorite cuisine. But based on these videos, I’m almost tempted to go just to try the Indianized version of our crappy American fast food that I never eat in the states!  The curiosity is kind of killing me now. 😂\n",
      "Domino's India have deteriorated a lot over the years, their cheese burst doesn't burst anymore, stuffed garlic bread doesn't have cheese in it, and most importantly they don't use \"cheese\" anymore, it's all veg-oil based cheese substitute. Even their customer care and store staffs are not as good as before. I used to love Domino's before but now it's a nightmare.\n",
      "I've been living in India for almost 10 years now and prefer its pizzas much over the Western menu. I still remember my first year in India seeing a big domino's ad where they'd advertise two new pizzas with 'exotic' vegetables, the exotic vegetables being broccoli and zuccini. goes to show that exotic is very much a question of perspective ;)\n",
      "FYI,we also have Garlic Breadsticks, Stuffed Garlic Bread,Cheese Dominator(1 pound of mozzarella cheese melted on the pizza),5 cheese pizza(1 out of those 4 cheeses is a Ghost Pepper flavoured cheese),Paratha Pizza,Red Velvet Lava Cake and Butterscotch Mousse Cake,which is the most heavenly thing available on the whole Domino's menu but it's also true that these items are region specific that's why it is there in Kolkata,West Bengal but not in Bangalore\n",
      "Loving this series. We get such boring Dominos pizzas here in the U.K.! The US pizzas looked good the Indian ones were interesting to see. I’d really like to try that apple dip and cinnamon sugar dough dessert from the US and the Indian chocolate lava cake looked yummy.\n",

      "When I lived in Japan about 17 years ago, MacDonald's had a burger called the McGrand. It had a creamy Dijon mustard sauce and a thick beef patty along with lettuce, tomatoes, and so on. It was so good that I still think about it occasionally. I was really disappointed when I moved back to Canada and it wasn't on the menu here.\n",
      "The Japanese packaging is cute. I’m also surprised Mcfloats aren’t a thing here. But the ice cream machines are always down, so maybe that’s a factor.\n",
      "I used to work as a manager at McDonald’s in Canada and I also travel to Japan often so when I do get McDonald’s in Japan, I often like to try something different there. \n",
      "It’s been a few years since I last went (partly due to Covid…), but I tried the locomoco burger and Hawaii blue drink and both were pretty good.\n",
      "Oh and the teriyaki burgers are pretty good.\n",
      "Coming from a person who’s from Hawaii, I’m surprised we don’t have some of the Hawaiian stuff that Japan has lol. As for the US side, missed the chance to add the Hawaii breakfasts.\n",
      "Also, who thinks they should send me to Tokyo to try the exclusives irl? That’d be a good series, right???\n",
      "Funny to see a Teriakyi burger. I can't have tomatoes due to GERD and other issues, so I tried to find a replacement to sauce my burgers with. \n",
      "I tried Teriyaki on my homemade hamburger, and it was a great alternative. Funny enough, Japan's Mcdonalds does the same thing, lool. \n",
      "My at home one was fantastic, so I have no doubt they love it :)\n",
      "The japanese sauce-packaging is awesome! This is probably the coolest thing i've ever seen at McDonald's\n",
      "A number of years ago McD did a limited \"Global Menu\" thing where they brought a few of their international exclusives to the US. I think the only thing they ever did before quitting it that I remember was a burger from Spain and a Stroopwafel McFlurry from the Netherlands. I don't remember trying the Spanish burger, it really wasn't anything that different. The Stroopwafel McFlurry was awesome tho, was sad to see it go. Anyway, I knew a little bit about the Japanese exclusive items, and was hopeful they'd continue it and do a run with a few of those here, the McTeriyaki Burger sounds awesome, and I'm surprised they haven't tried the McFloats here. Ice cream floats are a classic dessert in the US and it would be so easy. A Dr Pepper McFloat would be really good for US taste. I'm also kind of upset they ditched the Snack Wraps, probably a US exclusive you could have showcased here had they still been around. They had 3 that I remember, Big Mac, a barbecue crispy chicken one, and I think a bacon ranch one (?) wrapped in the same sized tortilla as the breakfast burrito. I think you got 2 per order, and They were a perfectly sized fast hot snack if that's what one was hungry for on the go.\n",

      "Food insider hit the jackpot with Nikhil as the host for Indian food. He does a really good job. I have one request and that is that you don't waste food by throwing it out after taking just one bite and instead cut off a piece from where you took the bite and offer it to someone who doesn't have food, it'll make that person's day and you wouldn't lose a thing.\n",

      "I remember getting in line for a subway at Delhi int airport. there was a line of say 6 people of which, 4 were non-indians. I was getting late and the line seemed huge. I was also wondering why so many foreigners were eating vegetarian, then one of them got in the front and the cashier told him that the non-veg line was on the other side and then they looked up and spotted that they were standing in the vegetarian line. The entire queue moved and I got my sub in time for my flight. Fun times!\n",

I finally was able to get over there the night before and made dough from scratch. My GOD what a difference! Additionally, I used your burger sauce recipe as the base for a BORGER ZA. Dough. In-n-out sauce. Mozzarella. Parmasian. Ground Beef. Pickles. Onions. it was sent from god... thank you papa\n",

      "Keep it up y’all!\n",
      "I love Sonny's enthusiasm to eat unfamiliar foods. He didn't show any grimace or fear of eating. By the way, we don't eat some of these foods everyday except for palabok, lomi and pares. Some foods are normally eaten during feasts and parties to enjoy with other people.\n",

      "As someone who is following channels like BuzzFeed, tasty, food insider and many more channels who review food of India vs other countries, since 2017, I'll have to agree that i GENUINELY enjoyed this video. The editing, the humour, the variety, everything is just so indulging and fun to watch. Rather than your average countless food comparison videos which feel like they're all the same, this was refreshing to watch. Kudos! Looking forward to more of this content!!!\n",

Chicken nuggets, krushers which is a milkshake with crushed cookies I like mine with oreos, Box master and crunch master which is like a shawarma and lastly KFC chicken salad....I almost forgot the double crusher burger with 2 pieces of chicken 😋😋😋😋. I'm now hungry 😅\n",

It's amazing the variety of pre made meals and frozen food they have! Everything look so good and Mikey said some of them are like eating from a restaurant. Impressive really!\n",
      "You are making me want to go to South Korea more, now, Mike! If even supermarket food is that good over there, how can I resist?\n",

      "As a fellow immigrant to Korea who's now living in Vietnam, I have to agree with these judgments, especially how Lotteria chefs took a quick look at a burger and tried to recreate it off sight alone. The only thing I'd add is that the mozzarella sticks at Lotteria are the best I've had from any restaurant over here.\n",

      "For those who don't know, KF Seetoh is a legendary street food critic in Singapore. He has really shine light on the traditional cooking methods and food culture, and guided the likes of Anthony Bourdain etc through his long career. I also personally respect that he does not put on airs or care about visuals the way other Singaporean food influencers do. He really cares 100% about the food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edited for grammar\n",
      "Incredible job on that video! He is an icon to local food and has been pushing hard to promote the industry. I think you found the right man to introduce Singapore hawker food. I saved almost 90% on my flights using Mighty ✋🏻 Travels 🤝🏻 Premium.\n",
      "This gentleman, Seetoh made this video a DELIGHT.  Usually I watch everything you do expecting your take on certain foods. This man had amazing knowledge of EXPRESSLY Singaporian dishes....and it was extraordinary.  Thank You!\n",
      "Love the fact that he's able to give us the history behind all the Singapore favorites. He was also a friend of Anthony Bourdain if you Bourdain fans may recall.\n",
      "Such a joy to watch KF Seetoh. His passion for the local food scene. The way he celebrates the hawkers and food stall owners. Couldn't stop smiling the entire video. 29:48 was touching. Love the guy❤️❤️\n",
      "Glad that Mark chose to work with SeeToh, someone who has lived the 70s/80s, someone who has tasted and knows how authentic Singapore Street/Hawker Food in the 70s/80s were like, and how they were authentically prepared and the ingredients originally used in that era.......things that young people wouldn't know.\n",
      "As a Singaporean I'm so glad to see KF Seetoh introduce all the food in less well-known (not the chinatown complex, hong lim or golden mile) hawker centres that's locally loved!\n",

      "So apparently the Japanese 7-Eleven's are like mini to-go restaurants, while the ones in the US serve packaged processed food, or reheated frozen processed garbage. It's almost an insult to call them the same store, how do we let them get away with this crap here?\n",
      "I don't think I've ever seen such a stark difference in selection and quality on a Food Wars ep before lol\n",
      "There's no comparison between U.S 7 Elevens and the 7-11 in Asia. Dramatic difference on quality of food and service. For ppl who live in the U.S and want to experience the Asia 7-11s, go to Hawaii. 7-11s are run by different companies in Asia which explains the significant difference. As an American, I barely go to 7-11 except if I need a drink. Food is mostly unedible unless ur drunk, high or don't care\n",
      "It seems in this series that George enjoys what he eats WAY more than Joe does. <3\n",
      "I’m upset that Japan’s 7-11 has actual proper food where we have nothing but junk food. Anyways, I’m excited that you guys are branching out to India!\n",
      "Me, as a European, am always so surprised about the drink sizes in the US. How can the smallest soda be 651ML!! That would in the Netherlands be enough for the entire family!! (I mean in Japan they have 1l and 1.5 liter packages but they are clearly to pour in glasses and share, they aren't portion sized...\n",
      "The Japanese chocolate doughnut looks much better than the one you’d get in America or here in the UK\n",

      "Mooshelle was really sucking it in for that fancy pants dance with chase.\n",
      "I started thinking that Moochelle looked like Chase this episode, then Rhett said Chase isn't Moochelle, and then Chase and Moochelle danced together. So I'm glad we put that to rest so efficiently and definitively.\n",

It actually works well and is a go to for when I want something fun and youthful.\n",
      "Hey Mark, I really love all of your videos but this whole Spain series is definitely your greatest work as of today in my opinion. I actually built my holiday around some of the spots you visited during this trip. Keep up the great work. You really inspire a lot of people. Cheers✌\n",
      "Mark, you are the reason I will be putting Spain as a place to visit and eat at after this amazing food tour you have done this far. Every place you have showed us on your tour looks just absolutely amazing and stunning. The ambiance and the energy of these chefs is just outstanding. Also the quality of the ingredients and the recipes they have shared with you is just mouth watering. Spain is now on my bucket list thank you for showing your experience there. I am excited to see what is next!\n",

I love the format – working with people who are as passionate about food as you – and they simply take you to their favourite food spots - genius. I'm totally loving Merrihue being with you now...I'll feel rather sad the next time he's not by your side in a video! Loving your work, Mark.\n",
      "What I Love about Italy & Spain is the simplicity of preparing their food, allowing the natural taste of the food to shine through. In America we overcook, over prepare our food! The freshness of this food makes you feel like you never had true prepared food. Mark, this is what sharing food is really about! In your own words \"Wow!!! Can't help but to appreciate you & your show!\n",
      "Hands down Gabriella is one of, if not, the best tour guide in Mark's channel! She knows everything not just about the food but also the city of San Sebastian!\n",
      "Would love to travel the  🌎 and eat food like Mark. His love for food and the culture and stories behind the dishes, absolutely beautiful\n",
      "The genius of Mark’s videos is his ability to take deep dives into countries and truly convey his experience.  After seeing James Blick here I got hooked on his Vlog just like I how I found Joel’s and JLJ’s vlog.  Don’t change anything Mark.  Don’t go cable, network or public television…just keep doing what you do!\n",
      "I'm so glad to see reviews on food from Spain. I never knew anything about Spanish food 'besides for western world Spanish food  like Mexico  to Brazil. I never was even interested i looking at Spain as a food destination and now its definitely on my food bucket list . So glad I've saved all the videos so if I ever go I can look book and plan a trip . Thanks Mark and Jeff.  And a big thanks to all of your guides on this trip. Im sure alot of these places would never be found easily.\n",
      "El mejor sitio del mundo para comer😋😋😋😋😋👏👏👏👏👏🐙🦀🦐🦐🦑🦑😍😍😍😍😍😍I love San Sebastián\n",

      "I'm constantly surprised by how well matt actually cooks, but then I remember that don't really make your life revolve around something without learning a thing or two\n",
      "I love how it took more time for him to eat popcorn than a whole entire chocolate cake\n",
      "The thing that I love about him is he doesn’t waste food and his thumbnails are real\n",
      "This was first video I watched from Matt  and I remember thinking \"no way he's gonna eat the whole cake\". Then I watched him more and realized whole cake was a \"piece of cake\" for him🤣🤣🤣\n",
      "I wonder if he has ever bite his fingers while eating so fast\n",
      "imagine inviting Matt to dinner and he puts on the timer\n",
      "My old time favorite video from Matt Stonie. Thank you, Matt Stonie, for the entertainment of competitive eating.\n",

      "This owner was one of the only one that I was on his side the whole time.  He was not egotistic, not in denial, accepts all the criticisms and opened to change.  He needs to be saved!\n",
      "I love how his son let his dad rage at him, knowing he needed to do it and being proud that he did it.\n",
      "I ate here as a kid before, during, and after the filming of this episode. My dad is vegan so we went here often. The food was always great and the son was who my family usually interacted with, he was always super nice. You could imagine my surprise when I got older and saw this episode lol. I never saw Gordon Ramsay but I saw the son and staff being interviewed one of the times my family went for breakfast. The potato pancake was my favorite on the menu! It's a shame the restaurant was sold and no longer exists.\n",
      "This man is a very gentle soul. It's hard for him to get angry\n",
      "this is a really good episode, lots of great moments. the son getting excited about his dad standing up for himself, the owner secretly shaking the pan while handcuffed, the owner eating the plants straight from the pot... a fun time\n",
      "So wonderful to see that guy love his Dad so much that he wasn't even disturbed with his Dad yelling at him, recognised that it was apart of his Dad's growth as a manager, and got so excited by it happening!\n",
      "The owner in this episode is such a sweetheart, bless his heart. It's sad that some of his staff take advantage of that. I'm so glad Gordon came to help and I hope they clean up their act and kick it into gear.  I really hope that after Gordon leaves that Dean will continue to put his foot down and have the restaurant and life he deserves. To be completely honest, the cook showed promise, but he didn't show up half of the time when he needed to and didn't listen to Dean and wants to say Dean is a bad man...that's ridiculous. Dean put up with Orelio (cook/chef) thinking he can do what he wants (mainly Dean's own fault) and so now that is what he expects. I would have fired his ass a long time ago.\n",
      "The son of the owner was very well spoken and respectful. I really loved how he was honest with his dad but also showed a caring side as well.\n",
      "I would literally eat here the owner was so respectful. You could tell he has a big heart and willing to do what he can to improve the restaurant. He's definitely not arrogant and takes criticism well.\n",
      "The owner is so down to earth, humble and nice. If this is my Boss I would literally work longer in that restaurant.\n",
      "I respect everyone who were involved in this. Seriously the best piece that I've ever seen on YouTube. HATS OFF TO YOU ALL! LOVE YOUR VIDEOS! ❤\n",
      "I love how Preston is for kids but has adult jokes in it\n",
      "Preston is type of guy who creates clickbait titles and clickbait thumbnails but the video ends up actually being what the title and thumbnail say, so extra awesome points to him\n",
      "The reason the unsalted fries are fresher is because no one orders them without salt so they have to make a new batch\n",
      "for me milk actually makes it 100x spicier, even if i'm not eating something spicy! just regular pasta burns my throat with milk!\n",
      "The egg blew my mind. We did some great research Preston.\n",
      "The cotton candy myth is based on how big your cup and how much  water it is,so technically it’s infinite\n",
      "for any secret menu you have to know what the parts of the item you want is\n",
      "The reason it feels spicier when you drink water is because the water makes the spice spread around your mouth\n",
      "the one about catching more food or not by sticking your tongue out is really gonna teach those women how to do it right\n",
      "ATTENTION FOOD WISHERS!!! SCAM ALERT!! I have no other account names on YouTube, and do not offer any prizes or special deals. Unless the message is from this account it's not me. Do not fall for scams by people using a similar name. Thank you!!\n",
      "Chef John always coming through with the best stoner food.\n",
      "I'm going to comment this on every potato video:  To simplify the de-starching of your potato, whether it's for chips, fries, hash browns, or whatever, use a solid-bottom salad spinner.  Fill it with water, swish your potato pieces, lift out the basket and dump and refill the water until it's clear.  Then dump the water and spin the potatoes.  You will get them super dry in just a minute.  Then you can lay them out on a kitchen towel or paper towel, but this will save you paper towels, because they will be dry.\n",
      "Of course, there is no reason you _must_ use my technique.  After all, you are the Johnny Depp, of your Potato Prep.  Enjoy!\n",
      "I have been coming back Chef John's recipes then and again for years. There's always great nuggets of advice (and reasons to chuckle) in these videos. Thank you once again, Chef!\n",
      "I’m allergic to sunflower seeds and most store-bought potato chips are cooked in sunflower oil, so this opens up my life to potato chips! Thank you, Chef John!\n",
      "The only problem is avoiding eating the first batch while the second cooks. I place my chips on parchment without the dinner plate. I also toss them in oil without rinsing them. My 1100w microwave takes 3 minutes per batch. Also, you can get a variance of 50% with the time required depending on the potato itself. Always keep an eye on it and never assume the time will be the same.\n",
      "Chef John - from beef wellington to potato chips in the microwave, the man does it all!\n",
      "I had to come back to say this works great! I used olive oil spray though and Lawry's season salt, but same result. Very crunchy. Only 6 minutes in my micro, so as Chef John said, watch them because everyone's micro is different.\n",
      "Also, kudos to the parchment paper trick to cut it round. But I think I did one too many folds because I ended up with 2 parchment paper circles attached together.  😁\n",
      "These look amazing ☺️. I hate the fact that store bought crisps (I'm watching from the UK) or chips are broken up into little pieces due to handling I guess. Thanks for sharing\n",
      "for years now I have had this overwhelming frustration when watching Chef John's videos...i just wanna give em more than one thumbs up.  such a legend\n",
      "Omg can we take a moment and say I am so impressed with how she takes care of her teeth while eating so much candy 😋\n",

      "Philipino cuisine is criminally under-rated! I’m Mexican American from So. California and believe it or not, I went my first 23 years of my life never having had the pleasure of trying it outside of a few random delicious desserts from my aunt’s filipina coworkers. Wasn’t until I started dating a half Filipina half white girl I first got to try it at a legit restaurant. I absolutely loved EVERYTHING! My family would always tease me for putting vinegar and salt on pretty much anything and when I realized spicy vinegar was a normal everyday table condiment I felt like I found my long lost relatives haha! That alone would have been enough for me but then dessert absolutely sealed the deal… HALO-HALO!… Are you kidding me filipinos!? That is crack cocaine in dessert form! And everything else! All of the sweet sticky rice flour balls filled with coconut and ube purple sweet yam and taro! \n",
      "\n",
      "I love my Mexican food and while I wouldn’t ever trade it for anything, filipino food seriously gives it a run for its money in my opinion.\n",

      "That movie theater butter flavor is thanks to something called “butter salt” (brand name Flavicol).  The compounds that give butter it’s buttery taste can be made artificially (or extracted from actual butter), then mixed with salt as a powder.  This is then mixed with oil, and that’s what movie theaters use.  You should dry age with the pure Flavicol powder — I bet that’d be incredible\n",
      "Has anyone mentioned that this BBQ sauce looks fantastic? \n",
      "Will you tell us how you made it Guga?\n",
      "Hey guga we know that dry brining steak is actually good so what if try dry aged steak using garlic powder and black pepper and let's see if it will work and will taste much better ☺️\n",
      "Popcorn oil is amazing. \n",
      "\n",
      "I used to work at a movie theater and we’d pop the kernels by adding one pump of oil into the hopper. One day I added a second pump of oil and the popcorn was amazing. Perfect golden color, savory, delicious. People complimented how good the popcorn was. I became the guy responsible for making all the popcorn. One day I showed a co-worker my secret and he thought, “if 2 pumps of oil is better than 1, then 6 must be amazing!” We received so many complaints over his oily popcorn. Had to throw the whole batch out in giant garbage bags. The lesson: a little oil goes a long way, don’t overdo it with that stuff 😆\n",
      "The juxtaposition between Angel and Leo's reactions is hilarious.\n",
      "Leo: The juices themselves you get from the steak are creamier, it's a little bit more savory, it's a little bit rich, whatever you did to it enhanced the flavors of the steak and made it an overall better experience, I love this.\n",

      "\n",
      "Without knowing what would happen if they would feed them heavy food, literally seconds after liberating them. The soldiers, thinking it was the right thing, started giving the Prisoners Apples, Sandwiches, and even Chocolates. \n",

      "\n",
      "After that incident, the Science team gave out an order to not feed the prisoners in the camps and to let the Medical Staff feed them first.\n",
      "It was mostly a slow input of light soup.\n",
      "The fact that Jimmy talked about refeeding syndrome and had a bunch of medical experts on standby really shows the precautions he takes behind the scenes. He's really serious about doing these challenges and definitely should be taken inspiration for a lot of people.\n",
      "There’s a story on YouTube about a crew of Japanese sailors who shipwrecked on an island and went a few weeks without food. They were eventually rescued by an American ship and the captain was extremely strict with what the starving crew ate. Making sure they only ate small amounts of soup. Ship captains in the 1800’s clearly knew how to deal with starvation. And it goes to show how easily knowledge can be lost.\n",

      "My grandmother told me this story: We're from the Philippines, and during the end of WWII during and at the exit of the Japanese occupation, the US military started to air drop supplies to the civilians including food. One of my grandmother's neighbors, a young boy, picked up a can of corned beef and ate it straight from opening the box of supplies. He dropped dead moments after. At the time my grandmother thought he died from choking to death, but later realized it must have been refeeding syndrome.\n",
      "I just feel the need to say as someone diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa I appreciate you Mat for bringing light to the dangers and science of them\n",
      "Slight correction: Pretty sure Gordan didn't know MrBeast was fasting until he literally started cooking for him. He probably would not have even started cooking if he knew. By the time he started, he definitely has the pride of a chef to have his target audience enjoy his food.\n",
      "13:15 just a quick correction there. Jimmy did do it for the content, but he stated in the comments it was also because he has Crohns disease, which means he has a nasty amount of gut inflammation. He wanted to know if fasting would help with the inflammation.\n",
      "I was in a pretty bad accident when I was younger, spent about 3 weeks in ICU hooked up to a nutrients IV and could only drink water with a straw while stuck in bed. I still remember the first time I tried to eat solid food after that. It was a little microwave Kraft Dinner cup. I took one bite and immediately was hit with a wave of nausea to the point and nearly vomited right there in my hospital bed. I haven't really been able to eat plain KD since then :/\n",
      "This is probably my favourite food theory video to date. This information could save lives of people who fast, whether voluntarily or not. As someone who has unfortunately been in a position of not being able to acquire food, I really appreciate this information. There had been times in which I went a few days without food, only to try and stuff myself. I only ever felt sick, and knowing it's my body's natural response is a huge perspective change.\n",

      "Looks great!  The bakery where I work makes blueberry cornmeal muffins - for dairy we use sour cream rather than milk/buttermilk and we also add a little lemon zest and vanilla, but otherwise very similar!  Someone has maybe already commented this, but we also toss the blueberries with one reserved cup (for a recipe of this size probably a couple teaspoons or a tablespoon would be perfect) of the dry ingredients before mixing them in to keep them from sinking.  Blueberries and cornmeal make a great combo!\n",
      "You can try coating the berries with flour before you mix them in. The flour coating on them slows down how fast they fall to the bottom of the pan. The same goes for things like chocolate chips.\n",
      "It's a common trick in a lot of baking circles, to toss the fresh fruit with a little bit of flour, before stirring in the fruit to your baked item. So for a pound of blueberries, perhaps toss them together with about two tablespoons of flour, which should keep them suspended in the batter as it bakes.\n",
      "I’m upset about other things in my life, and I’m still confident that I would love these (and not complain about blueberry placement)\n",
      "Perfect timing! We have two blueberry bushes that give us about 2 gallons of blueberries every summer, tomorrow the picking begins and will continue for at least two weeks, can't wait to try this recipe!\n",
      "This looks so delicious! Can't wait to try it!\n",
      "I've heard a good way to keep berries from sinking is to coat lightly in flour before adding them into the batter.\n",
      "I call the sweet style cornbread \"breakfast cornbread\" cause when it's paired with a glass of milk or cup of coffee it makes a great breakfast. I'm gonna try adding blueberries to my next batch.\n",
      "Looks delicious!  I've got a recipe for strawberry cornmeal cake, and I add the strawberries last and gently swirl them into the batter that's already in the pan to keep them suspended in-cake.  That being said, I also love cobbler so I don't have a problem with Blue Bottom cornbread either!\n",
      "I'm really impressed by how clean your oven looks! And of course, your blueberry cornbread, which looks heavenly! Can't wait to try this recipe!\n",
      "When he said his family couldn't afford the drinks in a packet when he was a kid and now he's travelling all over the world and has everything he likes, I felt so good! You have come a long way Mikey! Cheers to you!!\n",

      "When my youngest sister was about a month or so away from having her first child, I told her that the hospital takes the placenta and will make something like spaghetti or lasagna and that's the first meal after her baby was born. She kinda freaked out when they brought her a bowl of spaghetti. I'm such a mean brother 🤣🤣🤣\n",
      "Nothing Sonny tries shocks me anymore lol. I mean, drinking raw blood and eating a fish alive! Great content as usual!\n",
      "It's really interesting that you said that placenta's texture is very mushroom-like because there's a really good manga that featured evil babies that grew out their placentas into fake mushrooms so they could mind control the hospital staff by feeding them the placentashrooms. Makes you wonder if Junji Ito ate placenta before.\n",
      "In my hometown in Việt Nam when I was a child, we raised cows and we also ate placenta . It was not an everyday treat and in my opinion it is a delicious delicacy. So fascinating to see some Thai folks enjoy it as well.\n",

She had eaten a salad and cottage cheese the night before I believe and while yes she ate it, it wasn’t fulfilling so she at this pre-breakfast. She genuinely is vile iykyk\n",

Most other people don't like that, so we are called arrogant, rude, obnoxious, but we are not, we are just honest, and people don't like honesty. When we are considered high in the list of nations where spouses cheat on each other, it's not because we cheat more than you, it's just because we honestly answered the questions. You're probably wondering where I'm going with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I was reading all the coments about women being mean to each other, not staying friends with each other, yada-yada-yada, and I can't relate. At all.

I still know a lot of female who were already friend in High School (and I'm 40), whenever I see my mother, or my Girlfriend, or my Girl Friends, they are just friendly.\n",

      "I dunno, it's probably only on screen, but the number of time I saw in TV shows or movies a group of girls being friendly, then as soon as one leave, they all turn to bitch on this one; that's something I never saw in France. They bitch on her while she is here, and she doesn't take it badly, because she does the same.\n",

      "Why does American males manage to stay friends ? Because they trash talk each other, because they are honest, because they say things as they are. Yeah, sometimes we have fallouts, but we mend things,.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why can't female American stay friends ? Because they are sneaky, they lie, \"Ooooh, you look gorgeous girl\", \"You are so strong, I envy you\", while not thinking any of that. Sooner or later, in any relationship based on lie, the truth will come out, and it's not going to be pretty.\n",

Also excited because the BGM is done by Sam C.S who is an underrated music director who composed music for the original Vikram Vedha. Will need to check the songs done by Vishal-Shekhar who are also good music directors. Excited for the trailer!!\n",
      "The Tamil one, Sethupathi gave a more calmer yet menacing version of Vedha whereas Hrithik here seems to be out and out brutal. Really eager to see how good he has been throughout the entire movie.\n",
      "I've watched Original vikram vedha (tamil) and honestly I just loved Vijay setupathi as vedha and his mannerisms !! But I would love to see hrithik as vedha 🔥\n",
      "Gave me goosebump at the last, hearing the original bgm 🔥🔥\n",
      "This got me so hyped, especially Hrithik being the highlight for me. Also, the it factor for me was to see such a diverse talented cast and the bgm as well. Achara saying that it wasn't convincing actually makes me believe that she's just still adjusting to seeing Hrithik in a negative role because those eyes stood out for me, giving that maniac sadistic vibe that it was supposed to. And the background setting of Imambara from Lucknow though>>>>\n",
      "The movie is based on one of the Panchatantra stories of 'Vikram(Raja Vikramaditya)-vedha(ghost).. \n",
      "theme is where the raja is haunted by the ghost and it tells raja one story and asks questions at the end of each story. And based on the answer the ghost will take action.\n",
      "\n",
      "Panchatantra stories are the childhood stories about morals.. and the directors have made a nice depiction in the movie.\n",
      "Despite being a remake,  everyone is excited and going to support this film because of its outstanding starcast . Their performances is going to be fire 🔥🔥 , especially of hrithik . He never disappoints , always tries to bring something different to the audience .\n",
      "Tamil is a tremendous success. May they get that success or more in Hindi too. Looking at the casting, there is hope, and so are the directors. The end bgm is 🔥...\n",
      "A lot of people are missing the reason why Hrithik went in different direction to Vedha's character than Sethupathi's calm & composed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Vikram Vedha is based on old Indian folk tale/mythology of Vikram-Betaal(Baital) from Baital-Pachisi. Betaal is described as a creature/monster who questions king Vikramaditya's strong sense of justice. Betaal is little bit crazy, and inhuman (addressing Achara's concern), and that's the vibe I'm getting from Hrithik's Vedha's unlike Sethupathi. They are going more traditional route, and Hrithik didn't copy Amitabh's character from Agneepath, either. \n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, I like the approach original creators and Hrithik took for this one.\n",
      "While Everyone is Appreciating Greek God........let's take a moment to appreciate Saif as well, This Man is definition of diverse roles, from playing funny goofy college guys to playing Intense roles like Sartaj, Udaybhan ( in tanhaji) and Vikram, he proved that atleast one major Khan in industry works in realistic cinema as well. he also have maintained his physique and look at such age...... definitely deserves appreciation\n",

      "LMAO I don’t think y’all are understanding Junho’s character. Minwoo is his roommate. That is all. He’s keeping whale talk with Youngwoo to only lunchtime because he wants to get to know her. Therefore they talk about other things than whales anytime else. And his reaction to her in the wedding dress was his awakening to liking her. Lol he’s not confused\n",
      "It’s ok Don’t worry about the background Im glad my favourite YouTubers are doing their reaction ❤️\n",
      "the brides father in this is in a ton of dramas, he's really good at playing harsh grandfather or CEO types, usually if he's in a drama I watch it\n",
      "Junho and MinWoo are room-mates, that's why you saw him in the mirror when Junho was brushing his teeth. And at the end her father kept repeating the fact that she got him sushi to point out how ironic it was that his daughter went to a high-end restaurant but got him sushi (which is the japanese version of Gimpap, which is literally what he sells and what he made her for breakfast). It's ironic cuz if it were anybody else who went to an expensive restaurant, they would have brought back something that he usually wouldn't eat, not sushi. And in the car, the lawyer lady told him to stop talking to Young Woo about whales entirely, which is not what he did. He didn't listen to her cuz he doesn't find it annoying. The reason he set up a specific time is so she wouldn't call him while he's in the bathroom or if he's busy. Also, you could see he was disappointed when she said she has nothing else to say to him, and that's because he wants her to be curious about him but she isn't. So he already likes her.\n",
      "Im gonna become your patreon Just because this show and those hats. I love you guys!\n",
      "By the way if this hasn’t commented yet all the cases in the episode happened in real life or real cases. The was a lawyer who wrote essay about his cases, they bought the copyright from him, and hire him as their consultant as a lawyer to have the perfective of an attorney. This episode focus about being independent from your parent especially going into marriage, remember at the beginning Young Woo’s father wish that someday her daughter will get married because it all father’s dream to walk their daughter into the aisle and at the end of the episode YW said that if she will get married someday she will not throw the bouquet instead hand it to him so that he can get married since he never have a change to have one and just take care of her which is just the sweetest thought a daughter saying to a single parent so that he will not be lonely. Then our bride finally have the guts to be free from her father’s grasped because he is controlling her so much that she doesn’t have the say if she is arranged to be married. \n",
      "Lastly JunHo and Min Woo are friends and flatmates they are not gays😂🤣 anyway you will find out in the coming episodes.\n",
      "Her dad was being sarcastic (in the most compassionate way) when she brought him seaweed sushi from the expensive restaurant. Like, she had the option to bring him literally anything else from a place that's 300K per meal, and she brings something similar to what he spends all day making. It's like bringing a sandwich shop owner a sandwich with fancier ingredients. \n",
      "\n",
      "But from Woo Young Woo's perspective, gimbap/seaweed sushi is her favorite thing, so it was a gift of love for her dad.\n",

      "The Coen Brothers are two of the greatest American directors. I Iike all of their films, but, as others have suggested, “Fargo” and “Raising Arizona” are essential films to see.\n",
      "The fact that Walter practically causes half the film’s problems yet it turns out in the end, not to mention for all for the wrong reasons, he was right about everything.\n",
      "This film becomes much more enjoyable as you watch it several times.\n",
      "For how over-the-top Walter is, he is a lovable character.\n",
      "Having enjoyed two of the Coen Brothers' movies, you should probably watch a few more. \n",
      "I think \"Fargo\" is probably the one I would recommend most.\n",
      "\"Raising Arizona\", \"O Brother Where Art Thou\", and \"True Grit\" would probably also be on the short list for follow-up movies.\n",
      "Julianne Moore is an excellent actress, here playing an artist who wants to be a single mother.\n",
      "This movie's actually a play on the 1940s \"film noir\" style of filmmaking,  movie's like _The Maltese Falcon,_ _The Big Sleep,_ or later on stuff like _Chinatown_ about a jaded detective  starting what seems like a simple case to pay the bills but quickly spirals into a complex web of competing parties where just when you've got it all figured out, a new piece of info puts everything into a totally different light.\n",
      "\n",
      "So basically the movie is about how a scenario like that would play out if the \"detective\" was an aging hippy with no sense of self-motivation who is completely unqualified to deal with it. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the time it came out, people compared it to their previous film _Fargo,_ which while it had distinctly Minnesotan humor it was still a serious \"true\"-crime story in the end. But comparison _The Big Lebowski_ is a lot sillier and plays around a lot more with genre while ultimately having a story that's \"about nothing\", and people didn't like it. \n",
      "It became what's known as a cult classic after it came out on home video when all the couch potatoes gave it a second chance.\n",
      "True story and sad about Val Kilmer having throat cancer and pretty much unable to act again, and Tom Cruise fought to have Val Kilmer to be in the film. Writing in his condition and his appearance in the film was absolutely beautiful.\n",
      "38:48 A sequel that deserves - and gets - a wonderful reaction from Mish & Ellie. The final half hour of this is a real emotional wringer no matter what – but it’s especially intense and all the more adrenalin-filled, if like Mish & Ellie, you’ve seen the first film already.\n",
      "In the final scene:   It really is Tom Cruise flying the plane and it really is HIS plane.   He also owns and pilots a jet.\n",

      "Re Mav's F-18 being unable to fly again after his 'demo', pulling Gs damages the structure of aircraft. Too many Gs will break the airframe immediately, but even pulling less than that limit will still do damage: microscopic cracks that build up over time, invisibly weaking the airframe until it breaks, sometimes during normal non-extreme flying. To combat this, all aircraft have a rated 'G-life', that is the maximum cumulative number of Gs they can pull in their lives before they're retired as a precautionary measure. Mav's extreme maneuvers during the demo may not have broken his F-18 immediately, but they may have used up so much of it's G-life that it's effectively scrap anyway.\n",
      "It's really cool to compare the leap in cinematography when it comes to filming the action with the fighters. In the 80s it was amazing, but now it looks pretty calm, and the shots in this movie taken from inside and outside the planes are amazing.\n",
      "30:54 The numbers on the screen that were climbing was G-Force (G stands for gravity). 2 G's is 2x gravity. 7 G's is 7x gravity, etc. He pulled over 10 G's which means at that one particular moment he weighed 10x his body weight. The same goes for the aircraft. What he was saying to maverick was that he \"put so much stress on the aircraft that it bent the frame itself\" making it un-airworthy since you would have to replace everything anyway.\n",
      "I've been waiting for this one since you did the first. I'm so conflicted. I spent most of my life using Top Gun as an example that not all great movies need a sequel, then the bastards made one, and then they added insult to injury by making it so fucking good lol.\n",
      "It's the best action movie seen all year, and it's understandable why Tom Cruise went out of his way to get this movie seen in theaters. That feeling of watching a movie and feeling all the adrenaline was almost gone.\n",

      "My theory here:\n",
      "\n",
      "- That \"plant creature\" could possibly be that Fungus but in a more mutated form. As seen previously in the \"Missing Persons\" and  \"Autopsy Report\" videos, whenever someone dies in the Backrooms, they get covered in this black coloured fungus. This fungus is said to be growing and feeding itself onto the person it has attached itself onto (mutating itself onto the dead body). Given that how it takes a long time for certain funguses to mutate (100, 1000 or even millions of years at best) and also given that how time passes strangely in the Backrooms as seen by the researcher who was in the \"Informational\" video with the date 2/9/1990 looked as if he teleported when that strange bizarre flash appeared and his other group researchers vanished, however it wasn't teleportation but instead time travel. That researcher was all of a sudden sent to the future a couple of months ahead as it was shown in the \"Presentation\" video with the date 5/8/1990 when the alarm rang out and CCTV footage showing us the same researcher guy who by some miracle made it back to the entry gate point artificially created by Async. So by this logic, the whenever someone dies in the Backrooms, the fungus on the dead body has already reached the mutation stage in a short amount of time. The creature in this found footage has to be the driver who died in the car crash. As seen in Kane's secret video of \"9780415263573\", this car travelling at a really high speed on a highway suddenly no clipped through the road and due to the high speed, the driver wasn't able to push the brakes in time to stop the car. Thus it crashed into the wall as seen in the footage. The driver who was still alive at the time but badly injured seemed to have crawled his way to the room where this teenage girl encountered the creature and possibly bled to death there. The fungus grew on him and later the entire room in it's mutated form. Also it sounded like the creature was yelling out \"Help\" in a distorted sound possible the last words of the driver before his death in that room (which was seen in the \"original found footage\" video and later the \"Pitfalls\" video that this creature seems to mimic the sounds of it's last victims and in this case, even it's originator which is the driver). It's all just a theory which I just came up with. Don't take it canon lol.\n",
      "Speaking about Backrooms, You definitely should check out \"The Complex: Found Footage\" (free game on Steam).\n",
      "It's HEAVILY inspired by Kane Pixels version and NAILS the vibe.\n",
      "I have a theory for that green cracking in the walls.\n",
      "If you look closely at the entrance she came from, it widens!\n",
      "So I think that the backrooms was making a new nest for the \"entity\".\n",
      "But since the rooms entrance got so wide, the \"entity\" was given a chance to capture her.\n",
      "Also you hear it's roar before it cuts...\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit:just figured out that human blood causes the bacteria on bodies to grow.\n",
      "So the \"green lighting\" is definitely something else...\n",
      "Kane has proven without a doubt that he truly has serious talent when it comes to storytelling and world building. I can’t wait to see what he has in store for us later down the line. Glad to see you’re still keeping up with the series, Ryan!\n",
      "Lucky that steel energy card wasnt very old. Some collectors would be having a mental breakdown if it was. Also, love to see u got pokemon cards too and love to see more backrooms content!\n",
      "The humor and jokes of Ryan is just top tier easily one of the best comedic gaming YouTubers\n",
      "Theory for the green lightning at the walls in the end: The lightning looks VERY similar to the vines where the entity was nesting, so to theorize, the backrooms creates nests for those who are about to die as you can hear the entity getting closer and closer as the green lightning generates.\n",
      "If im thinking correctly, ever since they opened the backrooms, random \"holes\" have been appearing around the world, this kid and the car driver happend to stumble upon them.\n",
      "Imagine all the friends and family who went missing without a trace ended up in the Backrooms.\n",
      "12:03 I agree with Ryan, the sound design is on point, animations, world building too. Kane Pixels is a very talented 17 year old person\n",
      "No sequel to a movie that is over 30 years old should be this damn spectacular! I saw this opening night in IMAX and it was one of the absolute best moviegoing experiences of my life. The sound of the jets flying by, the literal feeling of the vibrations in your seat when the G forces kick in, and especially the visuals of seeing everything from the point of view of the pilots. I legitimately believed during the final dogfight that Maverick was going to die, so few movies today make me believe that!\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of all that, the story is so freaking amazing. The theme of showing how fighter pilots are still needed even in the age of drones, the story of Rooster learning to not just forgive Maverick but to let go of being so overly careful in his flying and “don’t think just fly”. And of course the most emotionally powerful if the movie when Maverick visits Iceman. Even though he has retired due to his throat cancer and has difficulty speaking he still managed to give an absolutely heartbreaking performance.😭😭😭😭\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you Tom Cruise for fighting so hard to get this movie in theaters.👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽\n",
      "Tom Cruise is truly the embodiment of megastardom! One of the best films in decades\n",
      "I love how Hangman could’ve been a typical cliche bad guy and he absolutely isn’t. He’s cocky and arrogant in Top Gun because that’s what Top Gun brings out of young pilots: their competitive nature. \n",
      "\n",
      "Once he’s on the aircraft carrier, he is all business, encouraging, and ready to help. I love that.\n",
      "Sad that Val Kilmer (Iceman) has been dealing with throat cancer these last few years (you saw him in Willow). But its beautiful how they wrote his illness into the story, and gave his character weight and honor.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also played Batman once. 🦇\n",
      "Spider-Man: No Way Home and Top Gun: Maverick both brought back the moviegoing experience in huge droves as both films became one of the first films to gross over $1 billion worldwide at the box office since the pandemic began. Also, Tom Cruise and Paramount made the right decision delaying this for two years because it's a film that's made for the big screen and everyone knows that.\n",
      "Mags, if you remember from the beginning of the first film, Penny Benjamin was mentioned briefly as one of the reasons why Maverick got disciplined several times.\n",
      "15:45 Val Kilmer lost his voice for real due to throat cancer. But they used an A.I. computer program to digitally recreate his voice. It was nice to see them bring him onboard for this movie. Heartwarming and one of the most amazing moments in the film. All because Tom wanted him to be a part of this movie so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got to meet Val Kilmer at a convention a few years ago after he beat cancer but lost his voice. He was one the bravest and kindest guys ever.\n",
      "I used to own a Betamax (Similar to VHS) tape of Top Gun many years ago and me and my 2 kids (aged 5 and 4) would watch it almost daily. Now they're grown up and have their own family and yet we got to watch Maverick together at home here in the Philippines. It was an absolutely amazing sequel and yes we all felt the stress and emotions just as you did Magy. Your reactions were so on point and wonderful to watch. Thank you!\n",
      "I'm with you Magy; I loved this movie and felt it was actually better than the first!\n",
      "Fun fact: The reason why the F-35 fighter that Maverick mentions when he's briefed on the target is not the ideal candidate for the mission is because of the GPS jamming.\n",
      "\n",
      "In actuality behind the scenes, the F-35 didn't have room in the cockpit for the cameras that they outfitted in the F-18s. They needed to have the actors ride backseat with real pilots in order to film the flight sequences and the F-35 couldn't accommodate that\n",

      "The genuine disgust everyone had at Otto telling Alicent to go to the King and give him \"comfort\" while wearing one of her mother's dresses is everything. I think Daemon is going to be a standout character thanks to Matt Smith's nuance portrayal of him. I loved Smith's delivery, and Daemon's blunt acknowledgement of the truths Viserys can't bear to face.\n",
      "\n",
      "As ever, thank you so much for sharing your reactions! Looking forward to the season to come!\n",
      "Poor Viserys. He's a good dude, but he suffers the human flaw that almost everyone suffers: he's adverse to hearing harsh truths about himself. Even from his own brother.\n",
      "when viserys was talking about the winter coming dany's theme was also playing it was so sad 😭\n",
      "Que nostálgico ver sus reacciones, me acuerdo que esperaba después de cada episodio la reacción del bar. Faltó gente, pero sigue siendo el mismo placer.\n",
      "Saludo desde Argentina, de un fan de GOT, que los conoció gracias a la serie ❤️\n",
      "I love how we never heard Daemon say “the heir for a day”\n",
      "Green Haired Girl is back and giggly as ever lol she’s dope though. My guy Shaggy is by her side of course. Al Roker Jr. is trying to be a scene stealer, he’s bringing all the sass. John Cena to his left is completely unbothered. David Spade is behind them for support. Hagrid and Chris Evans have new seats. This is great Sean!\n",
      "\"Promise me, Rhaenyra. Promise me.\" Echoes Lyanna's \"Promise me, Ned. Promise me.\"\n",
      "Such a good feeling seeing you guys back at the bar Watching Game of thrones. This just feels right.\n",
      "Targaryans have prophetic dreams, Called Dragon Dreams, However as Maester Aemon said \"I see them in my dreams, Sam. I see a red star bleeding in the sky. I still remember red. I see their shadows on the snow, hear the crack of leathern wings, feel their hot breath. My brothers dreamed of dragons too, and their dreams killed them, every one.\" The grief and glory of house Targaryen\n",
      "Daemon is being made a lot more nuanced than he was in Fire and Blood. The “Heir For A Day” brothel scene really makes me question him. We saw that he’s not enjoying himself at all, despite frequenting brothels before and renting this one out specifically to celebrate the Gold Cloaks’ accomplishments with the boys. Mysaria seems to be an enabling force, goading him into his darker tendencies. When he says “we must all grieve in our own ways”, I think he actually was somewhat saddened by Baelon’s and Aemma’s death. Daemon does want power, but he does love his brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Over the centuries, House Targaryen has produced both great men and monsters. Prince Daemon was both. In his day there was not a man so admired, so beloved, and so reviled in all Westeros. He was made of light and darkness in equal parts. To some he was a hero, to others the blackest of villains.” - Archmaester Gyldayn\n",
      "Absolutely in love with this new show already. Loved all the actors and Rhaenyra's \"Dracarys\" was absolutely amazing!\n",
      "Important to note there’s 10 adult dragons under targ control, but there’s also unhatched and juvenile dragons and also some wild dragons just chilling on dragon stone. So in total there should be around 17 alive in this period.\n",
      "That childbirth scene was gruesome. The screams affected me just as much as Shireen’s burning at the stake.😫\n",
      "\"House of the Dragon\" is inspired by George's book called \"Fire and Blood\" which tells the story of what was known as one of the most violent wars and power struggles within the Game of Thrones universe, the tragic fight was called  \"The Dance of Dragons\", and this event takes place 100 years before Daenerys.\n",
      "The funny thing about the book is that it is a kind of book within the universe itself, that's because \"The Dance of Dragons\" was a historical event and when reading the book as it is written, the impression one gets is that any inhabitant of Westeros could go to the library and read the same book telling about what led to the dance of the dragons to happen.\n",
      "And yes, it was just a book that tells about this event and it is already finished, so for the series we can expect less seasons than GOT, and a more complete story, different from the ending of got that was not written by George since the books still are not finished, but all the characters of \"House of the dragon\" were created by him as well as the basis of the story although some things can and will have some changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hope i helpedxx\n",
      "Targaryans have a history of putting a lot of stock in their dreams. The only reasons the house survived the doom of Valyria is because one of them had a dream it would happen and they packed up and went to Dragonstone. Even in Game of Thrones Dany had a dream about stepping into the fire that hatched her eggs. That's why she did it. This is the problem with watching this show and criticizing certain characters without having any book context at all.\n",
      "\"Why is it always in breech\" Breech is 3-4%, and rises sharply with multiple births, like the queen has. It's not common, but it rises to between 1 in 20 to 1 in 10.\n",
      "My underestanding is that the wife wasn't going to survive either way. So it was a matter of \"letting the gods take them both\" or actively killing his wife to save the baby. An absolutely terribly choice especially given how she would have to go through it. We've seen some horrible stuff, but her death scene was up there with one of Ramsay's scenes. I also think, given recent political events in the US, it was very timely without being an overt political statement like we might see from Marvel. Not to mention it was the pivotal moment that sets the stage for everything to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I hear this series will be far more morally grey than Game of Thrones ever was. Daemon gives me Ramsay or Joffrey vibes, but he'll be much more complex and less villainous. While he seems to operate on self-motivation, his violence isn't wanton or random like Joffrey or Ramsay. So I picture him being closer to a Cersei/Jaime style character. But if anything he absolutely gives PEAK Targaryen vibes and Matt Smith gives a stellar performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm really excited to see Corlys Valaryon and Rhaenys Targaryen. A shame we haven't seen much of Rhaenys but I picture her having some of Cersei's chip on her shoulder for being snubbed the crown. I hate to touch on this, but I know Corlys's racial \"change\" was of concern, and I originally had slight concern myself. Not because some \"OMG WOKE\" bs, but because of the Velaryons and the Targaryens are supposed to be basically siblings in relation, so I prefer representation coming from a new source rather than an existing one. But if you think about it, the light complexion of the Targaryens is much more of an oddity given their geographic origins. Furthermore, Valyria was awfully close to the Summer Isles and Sothoryos. So to me, Corlys is more what I would envision the original Valyrians would look like, so it doesn't bother me in the slightest. Especially after seeing him on screen. He seems like a GREAT character already and I think (and hope) he's up there with Davos.\n",
      "\n",
      " Otto Hightower gives strong Tywin and Littlefinger vibes prioritizing family image and political opportunity above all. He *does* seem like a *type* of man-of-honor, but more in the sense of being a strict rule-follower stuck in the old ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then obviously Viserys is the Ned Stark of the series. I LOVE seeing that name reclaimed. And while the timing was bad and perhaps more of necessity, I'm glad he apologized to Rhaenerys and shows a lot of faith in her. I especially like that when brought up with the council, the first response was \"There's never been a queen\" but one of the others was quick to chime in with \"Only out of precedent and tradition\". It's nice to see them consider it rather than the whole group quickly dismissing it has \"hah, but she's a WOMAN!\" Maybe Rhaenys serves as a reminder of what they could have had.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also while the age difference between him and Alicent is a little insane, and I don't like Otto pimping out his daughter like that, I do think they would legitimately treat each other well. Probably erring on the side of Viserys being distant with her because he misses his wife and is traumatized by her passing and the part he played in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of all, the show felt like we jumped straight into S3 or S4 of Game of Thrones.\n",
      "The way you both missed the babys death is hilarious\n",

      "This AveMaria composed by Igor Krutoy. Sang by Dimash. As you see this song is amazing 😊😍\n",
      "The composer of this is the piano player, Igor Krutoy. He came out of semi-retirement to work with Dimash. He has composed for people like Lara Fabian and Andrea Bocelli. 😄\n",
      "\n",
      "Igor wrote a post about this song on his IG:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One evening, about three months before the \"New Wave\", Dimash called me and asked if I could write \"Ave Maria \" for him, explaining that he wanted to sing something in that style... Coincidentally I had a free evening and I gladly sat down at the piano and, remembering the Italian formula of responsibility, worked with inspiration until I achieved the desired result. . . After taking a few days for the composition to \"rest\" in my ears, soul, and heart, I sent it to Dimash, who literally within half an hour answered that it was exactly what he wanted to hear. And of course, the reception and applause given to Dimash by the audience at the \"New Wave\" show what a happiness it is to do what I love, to write for such a genius singer, to evoke deep emotion in the audience and to be in demand... Just a short essay on \" What is happiness?\"\"\n",
      "Me dio risa cuando estaban hablando y riéndose antes de que Dimash abriera la boca y emitiera el primer sonido! Se quedaron mudos! Esta es la capacidad que tiene Dimash de cautivar al público, sin decir una sola palabra! Es maravilloso, esta es una composición de Igor Krutoy especialmente para Dimash, no tiene letra para que las personas de cualquier credo puedan disfrutarla, y vaya que lo logra! Gracias por su sincera admiración al magnifico Dimash! ❤️🌹🇲🇽❤️🌹🇲🇽❤️🌹🇲🇽\n",
      "This vocalise of \"Ave Maria\" was composed by Igor Krutoy especially for Dimash.  It goes without saying that this newest version of the traditional song(s) is almost beyond belief in its simplicity and power.  Nobody can pull off a vocalise as well as Dimash, the greatest vocalist I have ever heard in my 80+ years on this planet, and I've heard some really great singers along the way, and in every genre ever conceived.  What a blessing to experience this voice, this incomparable talent.  btw: Very nice reaction.\n",
      "Everyone expects the Schubert version but then Dimash and Igor blow their minds, with one vowel😁 👍\n",

      "UNBELIEVABLE recently filmed in Germany titled \"The Innovators\" featuring 5 young adults from around the world, who have turned their industries on their heads and impacted them forever. Opens with \"Dimash Qudaibergen at 28, is changing the face of today's music worldwide, widely considered a music and business genius..\" sole head and decision maker of his production company, it's state of the art on a campus of studios, stage, warehouses, conference and creative centers, and administration buildings, and produces every aspect of his career in house from films, videos, albums to concerts, tickets, sales and distribution of merchandise, PR, marketing, administration, legal and more.

      "He's not younger. This was 2021. He's was 27 at the time. Same as Stranger and Fly Away.\n",
      "This is an original composed version of Ave Maria by Igor Krutoy per Dimash's request. It does share some similarities with the Caccini composition and might have been the inspiration.\n",
      "Some have posited that because Igor is Jewish and Dimash is Muslim, they may have opted to forego the lyrics for this reason, which would make sense. Again, I don't believe that has been confirmed by either one.\n",

      "Such a shame we haven't got a sequel of this movie, Keanu it's a really good fit for the character.\n",
      "Also loved the portrayal of Lucifer. Al Pacino did his cool version of him around this time too, but Stormare blew him away\n",

      "Yay! This movie is underrated, IMO. So glad you’re seeing it. I’m sad Keanu couldn’t get it rolling as a franchise.\n",
      "Cool little detail you might have missed is that at the beginning when that guy finds the Spear of Destiny and then turns and looks over his shoulder at seemingly nothing, it was because he sensed Constatine was behind him. Later on in the movie when Constatine uses that electric chair to track  down where the Spear is, it shows him standing behind the guy when he finds the Spear. So it's like a little time travel thing.\n",
      "This was a great movie on its own and would've been great as a stand-alone series. Shame it didn't get a sequel, but I like it as it is as well. I know some people don't like it because of it not reflecting the comics character as much, but I say it was a very good version of it.\n",

I'm not going to compare it to the original as original will always be original but I've high hopes from this film because it's the same duo who directed the original one. Personally, I don't have any problems from a remake and I don't think remaking something is a crime. The remake, however, has to be good. If it doesn't justify the acting of the original actors then it's a crime otherwise if it's a remake like Kabir Singh (which is a really good remake) then I don't have any problems and I feel this remake will be genuinely good\n",

      "\n",
      "A simple logic, if theses actors (Including the Kumars, Khan's, Devgans, Kapoor's, Roshans, etc) start charging 10 to 50 lac per movie,  the theater ticket price will drop automatically and eventually we can start enjoying movie in the theaters with our families at a much lesser price.\n",

Everyone can agree that the recent Vikram Vedha teaser is really well stucked piece of art. Yeah it's a remake but why it has made ? Because the original one was not popular at all and it holds a great contents so why not it should be showcased second time . Hrithik Roshan is someone who thrives himself towards great art work . So guys don't take seriously these kind of nonsense review by a nonsense person like KRK ✌️✍️\n",

      "It is true that we didn't hear Daemon said \"The Heir For A Day\" and his account might be true after all when he said we each mourn our own ways. We are only told via Otto's report, and we know they despised each other. The labeling could be interpreted in either good or bad way. Just like the title \"The Queen Who Never Was\" could be considered a mockery but also it could mean you acknowledge that she should be the queen. Maybe Daemon is indeed honoring his dead nephew. One thing is for sure though, i think his love for his brother is genuine, however rogue his ways are. He knows his brother is weak and he sees Otto Hightower for what he is, he really wanted to protect his brother from crows that's waiting for a feast. He's definitely going to be a grey character and they tend to be the most interesting.\n",
      "19:32 ,that's what you got from Daemons smile? how are everyone giving daemon \"villain\" tag so quickly.  It feels like I saw some other episode and many other people saw another. It felt more like \"my brother knows me, he's right, these other idiots know nothing\" smile.\n",
      "Daemon is Vicious and acts douchy but also cares about his family from the scenes before with rhaenyra & at the funeral.\n",
      "I actually loved Daemon he seems to actually love his family as soon as the king said why would I do that about not making him his hand.Daemons immediate answer was cause I’m your brother!!It didn’t sound like it was a birth right thing but that he was actually hurt his brother didn’t choose him and he’s for sure not wrong the console is playing him they see his weakness and you can afford to show weakness as a leader it’s a fact!\n",
      "So excited you guys are reacting to this. Can’t wait to start this journey with you both! 🙌🏾\n",
      "I think everyone just antogonising Daemon but personally i dont think he's bad guy ,he's just an extreme person and soon enough they will notice how necessary he was .\n",

      "\n",
      "NB:like this comment  if you think so too . Cause i have a gut feeling by the end of this season or maybe next people will understand him (Eren yager effect)\n",
      "After the foul taste the original GoT left in my mouth, I didn't have very high hopes for this. Yet I watched it and it honestly feels like the earlier seasons, maybe not quite there yet, but definitely enough to have me hooked and wanting more of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I find it hard to pinpoint Daemon, on the one hand he wants to show strength (the city watch part), but then he's also arrogant (the tournament, claiming victory while the fight wasn't over) and straight up horrible (heir for a day?). But on the other hand, he really cares for Rhaenyra and at the funeral he told her, her father would need him more now than ever before, which shows he also cares for Viserys. I think him calling Viserys weak, was his blunt way of telling Viserys to watch out for those at the council and act like a king, which is in line with what he did with the city watch, he feels like the king should show his strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "Viserys seems like he's held things together for those 9 years, but this clearly is coming to an end, I feel like he's made a huge mistake by alienating Daemon, this won't make things easy for Rhaenyra, who already has to fight the fact that some people don't want a woman on the throne. In the end I think it will be between those two and Viserys will be long gone from the picture.\n",
      "They referenced the White Walker prophecy at the end. When the King was talking to his daughter. Seems it’s a warning passed from king to king. Little did they know it took 172 years to come to pass. And the King even says, A Targaryen has to be on the throne to win that Cold War!\n",
      "Yes, it’s rumored the throne rejects those who aren’t worthy by cutting them!\n",
      "This whole series will show us how such a powerful family like the Targaryen’s become the died off long lost house we see in Season 1 of GoT. When Daenerys was with her brother cast out and ridiculed. \n",
      "So we’re gonna see what they did to themselves to become that so low and from 10 dragons on total around in this series, to Dragons no longer even exist! In GoT and are old rumors. \n",
      "Each Targaryen pairs with a dragon, either a new one or one passes down from a deceased relative. There are young and old dragons, dragon eggs, trainers and keepers! So cool\n",
      "Pretty sure that daemon didn't actually say the \"heir for a day\", even in the books it's implied that Otto might have made it up to drive a wedge between the brothers, and daemon just didn't want to say anything at that moment. He is vile but he has his brothers best intentions in mind for sure\n",

I don't support anyone of them prince and his wife had milked there child and they not tackled any of the allegation he was just taking out his anger making personal comments but I can't just blind eye on things that Lakshya said just because I'm his subscriber and this had cleared that the past allegation like ganging up, bulling, were some how true . Lakshya portraying an image of the person that he is not thinking we should not abuse in YouTube because it's an public platform and spread hate but can make an abusive live video on Insta I guess Insta is not a public platform anymore and it's strike one thing that  lakshay is not abuse because of the problem that he had faced in his past for making that kind of content\n",
      "Let's w a moment to to appreciate how much effort he puts into his contact to entertain...❤️⚡\n",
      "The best part about the teaser is that both Hrithik and Saif look drastically different from R Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi. And very honestly, Hrithik's Vedha is looking slightly more menacing than Vijay's. I'm cautious but highly excited at the same time 🔥🔥🔥I'm quite hopeful towards this movie coz the directors of the original have made this as well and if I'm not wrong they've said it ISN'T a scene to scene remake Hopefully optimistic 🤞🤞\n",
      "I’m from Chennai, but I’m a big fan of Hrithik, and don’t tell me it’s a remake, it’s a beautiful script which is worth to be filmed again 🔥🔥🔥 and I’m glad Hrithik is doing the villain role\n",
      "I respect to everyone who wear involved in seriously the best piece that ve every seen on YouTube hats off to well all i love your video 💕\n",
      "Hrithik is next level no one can beat him 🔥🔥🔥\n",

      "This is what reaction channels  should learn from pj , straight to the fkng reaction without talking any trash and it genuinely feels like he is watching it for the first time . as always pj nevee dissapoints .\n",
      "PJ Never Dissapoints while saying \" Maine Original movie Nahi dekhi \" 😅\n",
      "Chalo Mai bhi likh deta hu PJ never disappoints 😂  btw sach mein nhi karta ye banda disappoint 💯\n",
      "You should watch the original movie featuring R Madhavan and Vijay sethupati..... it's a masterpiece ❤️\n",
      "First time after a long time after Kabir Singh, this look promising. I watched original. I don't want to know about story line, i just want to see the Maniac and dense acting of these two.\n",
      "It's directed by original director so hell yeah I'm gonna watch it\n",
      "I love the original Tamil movie. The Tamil version solidified Vijay Sethupathy as my favorite actor. The whole concept of setting up the story in the Vikram Vetal backdrop was so unique. The climax fight- Vedha has a 'come what may'/ unhinged/ chaotic attitude- and the crazy banter between Vikram and Vedha during the fight .. it was absolutely fresh to look at... Personally I love both Saif and Hrithik. I really don't want to compare VJS and Hrithik. I'll be honest, I was skeptical about the remake. But the teaser does look promising. I love Hrithik's attempt at being the unhinged 'Vedha'. Except for the accent, as you rightly pointed out, the teaser does look promising. Even though the bgm is very good, I was just hearing the bgm from the original in my head! I do miss it... I really really really hope and pray this movie does well...\n",
      "There's this eccentricity in Hrithik's eyes that tells me he'll do full justice to this role. He has his own unique style, and won't be just mimicking Vijay Sethupathy. I have faith in this movie because of the makers, really looking forward to it. People just have to approach it with an open mind, rather than being so negative even before the release.\n",
      "The only thing that's exciting me in this film is Hrithik's portrayal of a gray shaded character. Hrithik Roshan mostly cuz the guy is just so good but in these kind of roles, it always just fascinates me to watch one of my favorite actors to perform.\n",
      "That Sam CS BGM towards the end gave me massive goosebumps!!!\n",
      "Vishal-Shekar and Sam are gonna kill with the soundtrack!!!!!!\n",
      "The only thing that matters is box office. Hrithik's Agneepath was a box office hit and his Vijay is totally different from Amitabh's Vijay. If he can succeed in making a new Vijay then I don't know why people are saying can't match Vijay Sethupati. All that matters is box office rest people will always criticize no matter if it's actually great.\n",
      "Initially      When I heard that Hrithik Roshan is playing role of Veda ,I doubted if he could fit into that role which Vijay Sethu Pathi immortalized that Character.After watching the Teaser I am surprised and excited to see Veda in this remake version.. Congratulations to both Heroes Hrithik Roshan and ofcourse  Vikram role is tailor made for Saif ali Khan .\n",
      "Fully agree with you regarding that scene where Vedha (Hrithik) is smiling devilishly while spraying bullets! People have the habit of complaining ... and most of the people who are complaining, they have not even watched the Original VV. And yes, Hrithik did not copy Amitabh, and similarly here, he did not copy the Great VS!\n",
      "In orginal movie and trailer specifically, both Vikram and Vedha were projected to be equals. Given equal screen time, dialogues and actions. But here I believe Hrithik is being pushed more than Saif and that's what bugs me..\n",
      "I've just recently watched the original but I've to say that this teaser actually looks really good. I'm not going to compare it to the original as original will always be original but I've high hopes from this film because it's the same duo who directed the original one. Personally, I don't have any problems from a remake and I don't think remaking something is a crime. The remake, however, has to be good. If it doesn't justify the acting of the original actors then it's a crime otherwise if it's a remake like Kabir Singh (which is a really good remake) then I don't have any problems and I feel this remake will be genuinely good\n",
      "I like how they made Hrithik a bit devilish instead of Vedha being the calm guy like in the original. I feel like VJS's Vedha is how Mohanlal would've played Vedha and Hrithik's version is how Mammootty would've played the role.\n",

      "Me: YES\n",
      "This is really an amazing animated video that creates goosebumps and fills every Indian's heart with pride, joy and sadness as well. The creator mentioned the name Assam but I want to add more names of freedom fighters, who are from Assam and equally contributed. Foremost name is Kanaklata Baruah, just a 17 years old girl and she took bullet while hoisting Indian flag and died on the spot. Other freedom fighters are Gopinath Bordoloi, Jyoti Prasad Agarwala, Maniram Dewan, Kushal Konwar, Hem Barua (Tyagbir), Bhogeswari Phukanani. Other prominent freedom struggle unsung heroes from Northeast India are Major Paona Brajabashi, Bir Tikendrajit Singh, Rani Gaidinliu (13 years old Naga girl), Haipou Jadonang, U Tirot Sing Syiemlieh, Moje Riba, U Kiang Nangbah, Pa Togan Sangma.

Well, actually, I'm right there with the squire losing it in the background of the joust, then I take the shot to calm my nerves and stomach. Cuz yikes.\n",

It's been so long since we got to see you guys all together again, thank you for bringing this back! Much love from Oregon <3\n",

      "Daemon Targaryen aka the Rogue Prince is the best Targaryen in the lore of ASOIAF, and I can't wait for yah to see more of him. An we all should take some time to praise Matt Smith for his portrayal of the character, because it's nothing short of perfection. The show runner's hit it out the park with the casting for all of these characters in this prequel.\n",

I already missed you so the next one is as soon as possible 😅🤧Jungkook and Jimin are the ones who get hurt the most they always give more than they expect and often get hard on themselves and often exhaustion and fainting. just for everyone to see the best of them in every performance it hurts armys to see him this way\n",
      "Jungkook and Jimin are definitely the ones who push themselves the hardest during performances, they are both the ones I noticed who are getting injured or almost passing out, and its sad because when their own stage they seem so lively and full of energy and then these documentaries come out and you realize when they went back stage they were suffering. \n",
      "\n",
      "Jungkook has gotten injured multiple times, he's almost fainted a lot of times there was this one award show they went to and jungkooks hands were literally shaking and he fainted MULTIPLE times or came close to it....\n",

      "Guys..I'll ask again. But may you please continue and go back to the bonus content and deleted scenes you missed. I'd really like to see you to react to them as they are IMPORTANT parts of bangtans world and connected to bangtans history, shows how their emotions developed and changed over time, and give further context to a specific era /episode of the rise of bangtan. I hope you don't just brush them aside as it's really good imfomation to note as well as has all those behind the scenes you always like. Not sure why that changed but I hope you'll quickly return to them before it gets too far off. It's a helpful smooth transition between episodes as well. Because it gives you a mental break and as I said, really just gives you more and more context and content. As the series goes on they'll be more and more important to the series too. Whether that's answering questions you may have had during the episode or clarifying something that couldn't be further explored in the episode itself. You've already missed so much content. At the very least it's be nice to have a reason why you stopped all of a sudden when it's importance hasn't diminished but increased every episode..\n",
      "Becoming ARMY truly is a life-changing experience, and one that anyone who hasn't done any of the work to look back at their history and discography can never understand. I would have never thought that at the age of 54 I would become such a huge fan and supporter of the \"boyband\" my daughter had been a fan of for three years already at that point. 2 years later, almost to the day, and I look back and shake my head in wonder at how much of an impact that 7 young men only slightly older than my daughter have had on me. Because they have been utterly unwilling to listen to me or delve into the group themselves, they have zero understanding and they all think I'm crazy, I think. All I can think is how sad it is that they won't give them a chance and experience the same thing I have. I like the reactors who become true fans and are open to the life change that happens when they open their minds and hearts to the beauty that is BTS. You guys are that kind of reactor and it's wonderful to see.\n",
      "Guys is there a chapter 22 or it ended at 21 \n",
      "Jungkook is really hard working and perfectionist he want to go on stage matter what happens to him \n",
      "He is turning 25 very soon 💜 he grew up 🥺\n",
      "Remember all the deleted and bonus episodes. A chapter is not actually over until you watch them. Maybe you didn’t know? I really like to watch you react to Rise of Bangtan, but it’s beginning to seem a bit weird to me that you don’t finish a chapter until moving on. Your reactions always seems genuine but it has made me question wether you actually want to continue this series? It’s fair id you don’t. This is just so weird, sorry\n",
      "Can't wait for episode 14 the rise of bangtan chapter 14 \"Filter\"\n",
      "To anybody who's reading this, I pray that whatever is hurting you or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better. May the dark thoughts, the overthinking, and the doubt exit your mind. May clarity replace confusion. May peace and calmness fill your life. 🙏\n",

      "Imagine this:\n",
      "You wake up in a room that you've never seen before. The bed you're lying in is very comfortable. You sink right into it. You don't want to leave, but you want to know where you are. You sit up, and looking around the room, you see that it looks like you're in a very cozy, but very old room. This room has seen many, many things, it seems. There's a mirror to use, in case the person staying in the room would like to fix themselves up to look nice. There is a closet full of clothes, however you see that there is already an outfit laid out for you. If you prefer the feminine choice, it is a beautiful seafoam green dress, with a black and white striped bow and reaches just below your knees, grouped with black mary janes and long, white socks. The masculine option is a suit that consists of the same colors in the most similar areas, with black dress shoes. You put on the outfit of choice and you leave the room. You go down the stairs of the house to find two people. They look like blonde twins. One is a boy, the other is a girl. They are sipping their tea when one of them notices you. \n",
      "\"Oh! You're awake!\" The boy cries. \"So they are!\" The girl replies. They introduce themselves as Aaron and Anastasia. Aaron tells you that, since you've been asleep all morning, it would be good for you to go outside with them. You reluctantly agree, but all of your worries fly out the door when you step outside. You see a field that looks like it was masterfully painted a nice mix pastel colors by the gods themselves. There are mountains in the distance, and you can also see a nice pond. In the sky, you can see the moons, and even a planet or two. You can even faintly see the stars. There are trees by the pond and one of them has a pair of swings. The three of you walk up to that tree, and you spend the rest of the day playing there, the twins took turns pushing you on the swing. Eventually, night came, and you went back to the house for dinner. Anastasia made the most delicious bread and pasta you'd ever had, and Aaron did the dishes, insisting that you relax as their guest. After a little while, you retired to your bedroom, changed into the clothes given to you, and succumbed to a calm, dreamers sleep, wondering what the next day had in store for you...\n",

You are not being measured by how tall you can stand, but by how many times you can get up before you give up. Run until your legs give out, swim until you drown, climb until you fall, life is short. Endure the agony that comes because it can't last. Why not see just how far you can go? I believe in you. Im running too. Im climbing too. Im swimming until I can't anymore. I refuse to drown.

      "It was around the summer of 1974 when a friend and I went to the Fresno Zoo. As we approached the hippo area we could see one in the water. We watched it for a little while then started to walk away when suddenly this little baby hippo head broke the surface of the water. Needless to say, we were captivated by this tiny baby hippo that was frolicking in the water around its mother. We could hardly tear our eyes away from the delightful sight. Later that night  the local news show had a report about the new baby hippo that had just been born at the Zoo that day. That baby hippo was one of the most adorable baby animals I've ever seen!\n",
      "I couldn't stop smiling throughout the entire video and my heart just glowed with an aura of golden love! Thank you so much for making our day brighter by showing all these adorable little darlings. If I could, I'd adopt one of each.

Though I am a believer of Megs still existing, it's very clear from the gate way that this find, isn't as rare or \"mega\" as they think.\n",

      "Pretty sure the \"Shape Shifter\" was a new species of deep sea Squid.  There are various squids that have wedded tentacles, such as the vampire squid. Also the 'Ghost Squid' is a Magnapinna Squid no doubts about it. It doesn't any different from any Maganapinna Squid I've ever seen. Their nick name is Bigfin for a reason.\n",

So when the lion goes to attack the zebra he might pounce too soon, and when he is in the chase he will find it difficult when to strike out with his claws. The same thing was used against submarines.\n",

It is also funny how our teacher is always warning us that it's focused a lot on american context. :D Which is true, because from this video it looks like USA has one of the best educational systems, which is deffinetly not true. Here in the Czech Republic compulsory school attendance functions since 1774. Also our entire educational system is free and there is no religon in most schools (public or private). Of course there are many countries that have worse educational system than USA, but I don't think you have the best one. But it's just my opinion, so please don't come at me... :D\n",
      "A more cynical perspective on why public (state-funded) education became so popular and important for industrialized countries is because their workers now required more knowledge in order to be efficient. They needed to be able to read and write and have basic numeracy skills to operate machines. If the cost of teaching and training people was passed on to the state, then companies would not have to spend money or time giving their workforce the tools they would be expected to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worryingly, the same is happening nowadays. Many companies complain that people leave college/university and are \"not prepared to enter the workforce\". They want someone else to teach people to be good, efficient workers, so that the employer can make the most of their staff from day 1.\n",
      "Educational institutions usually leads to an enrichment of ideas and a chance to gain an upper hand in terms of either gaining higher degrees or being more effective in your current job. Though there is inequality in terms of learning acquisition (neighborhood, preconceptions of people, and income) which affects HOW much of the education will actually be grasped by the pupil (student). It’s fascinating seeing how societies construct various institutions for the given populace to work around in. Loved the references you used as well!\n",

Most kids learn how to memorize material and pass tests, but only certain kids verse themselves well enough to approach extra credit problems that weren't covered in class and actually require thought.\n",

      "Interesting. My learning style is: slow.\n",
      "My grade 8 science project, back in the late 80's, was on learning styles. My teacher was shocked and surprised when I submitted my project idea. All my subjects were my classmates. Over a span of a couple weeks I tested their comprehension of certain short stories, pictures, and videos; through visual, audio, and reading. When the science fair day came, my booth wasn't the most popular with any of the other kids, but with all the school teachers and parents... they loved it. I remember the results of my project was inconclusive because I tested each student individually with each individual method of learning. No one method of learning is better than another, but combining multiple methods of learning is where results would be seen. But I ran out of time to combine methods of learning before the project was due.\n",
      "I worked as a high school teacher for thirty years. Over the years it gradually dawned on me that the many educational theories, which were forced on us were based on absolutely nothing but unproven theory. Learning style was just one of many. Nearly every year a new style or theory would be introduced. Nobody ever rigorously challenged these theories (presented as facts) demanding evidence and proof. Ever. Yet if you did not adapt your teaching to incorporate these unproven styles you would be judged to be a failing teacher. So you had no choice. At least whilst being observed!! I became quite cynical in the end because I realised the new methods were invented and then promoted by people just trying to further their career with something for their CV. And each method would last a year or two before going out of fashion and being replaced by a new one. God forbid anyone would actually just leave the teachers to use their own experience, education and intelligence.\n",
      "I had an excellent, and very intense mathematical statistics professor for whom varying teaching style *WAS* his teaching style. I recall, one day for an hour long lecture, he came in and wrote notes and provided examples and proofs, and he never said a single word. In another day, he switched his handwriting to beautiful, perfect cursive. He was a bizarre teacher, but pushed me to the absolute limit. Great prof!\n",
      "I’ve been self-studying A-Level Maths for the last two years and I think the real method to learning in my own experience is ‘repetition’. Similar to how you would work out in a gym, the more you do it the better you become at it.\n",

      "I think I’ve taught myself more in the last two years than any of my teachers ever did in school.\n",
      "i'm a pressure learner, i only learn school material when there's severe stress and doubts about my future imposed on me\n",
      "People learn easier when they are interested and is enjoying to know a topic. Also, if you understand schooling, as the obligation of attend to school and have satisfying grades, and education, as acquire knowledge through studying for self interest, it will not only be clearer that we learn only what we want to know, but also, that several government regulations on schools around the globe is actually, making people dumber.\n",
      "I'm a teacher in New Zealand and VARK was covered in my teaching degree 17 years ago. We did questionaires to determine the order of our preferences, but we were told to try and cover all these aspects in our teaching, ie try and give the children a verbal aspect, and an auditory aspect, and a reading aspect, and a kinaesthetic aspect. That sounds more like the multi-modal approach you described. I remember I came home very excited about it and suggested to my wife that she do the questionnaire as well. She looked at it and said \"I don't want to read all that, can't you read it to me?\"\n",
      "I feel like the \"learning styles\" myth has ultimately HELPED teaching, though.  It's encouraged teachers to be more multimodal in their TEACHING style in order to (in their minds) reach a wider variety of learners.  Even if the hypothesis was wrong, it's ultimately created a stronger teaching style.\n",
      "Twenty years ago I gave a small talk about VARK to my fellow educators. The key point in my plenary was that learning styles are not separate, but complement each other in a holistic manner. Over 47 years I have found many 'keys' to assisting students to learn : humour, comfort (having eaten, slept well, etc.) pause frequently to review points, question your own knowledge openly and invite students to do the same as they learn. I loved teaching and was only persuaded to finish when the paperwork before AND after took more time than the educating.\n",
      "I'm glad I live in the age of the internet. I learn every day. I've never stopped being a student.\n",

I don't feel like it's what I should do with my life but this video has revived me slightly and reminded me that this was/is my vision and not to be bogged down by the current system. Awesome videos!\n",
      "Every single one of these videos is perfectly made, with amazing points. Everything is so well thought out! These videos make the world a better place.\n",
      "I am a teacher. I love my job and I need to tell you this is happening in schools. It is pushed for students to learn and understand life problems. We call it the \"hidden curriculum\". It is what teachers facilitate in their classrooms. Teachers put students in many situations and help guide them in appropriate ways. Or guidance about finding themselves and their interests. Or understanding money (which is definitely in the curriculum). You are correct it is NOT as blatant as this example and I wish it were more but your next video I would love to see your solution to this problem. The education system knows this is where we want to go. They just don't know how.\n",

      "Schools definitely needs to teach the various biases and fallacies. Funny thing about them is that by simply knowing, people will commit much less of them. This is one of the purest example of \"knowledge is power\" and most certainly belongs in a curriculum.\n",
      "Great work! #The School of Life\n",
      "It's really heart warming that you made an effort to study the current education system and provided with a simple solution like focusing on the life challenging subjects, having said that, I don't want this to be just anther video, I want us all to collaborate and design a real time working ed. system, test and work on it at small scale first then making it bigger(later), because i don't want the future and the current generation to suffer the same fate as we did.\n",

      "\n",
      "It just took time away from learning things that were actually useful in class, it frustrated the teachers attempting to teach it, and it cost the school a lot of money to get all the printed math books and other Common Core materials for essentially no benefit to the students.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can’t recall a single time Common Core was spoken of positively by the teachers or the other students.\n",
      "I think we can all agree the schools need to incorporate financial education  all throughout high school.\n",
      "So we found that the problem wasn’t the education system per se but the circumstances that children grew up in. And rather than even entertain the possibility that an inequitable socioeconomic foundation was to blame, it was easier to say “kids aren’t learning because there’s something wrong with the books, teachers, and schools.” I love how simple it is to explain so many crappy circumstances through the lens of cognitive dissonance. Now we’ve graduated to blaming lack of homeownership on people being too indebted as opposed to a dearth of housing options in the places where people actually want to live (or more accurately a dearth of places with housing where people actually want to live.)\n",
      "I dropped out of high school when i was held back in 11th grade, and got my GED at 2 weeks before my 19th birthday, the GED tests were way easier than end of the year tests in regular school\n",
      "What most people don't understand is that basic education is 80% culture. You can't just write a list of things to learn, you need to design an engaging environment for people to receive information and play out tests. You also need to include the parents of children to make them understand and play in key of the curriculum.\n",
      "I've taught the A-levels (UK) and the Florida/Michigan curriculum at international schools. The US has a lot less focus than the UK. Americans are confused about what \"raising standards\" really entails. Foreign curriculum pushes students to master a smaller set of skills with smaller textbooks and more essay writing whereas the US focuses on a wider range of concepts with superficial multiple choice polling. Often this leads to foreign students having mastery and being well spoken about foundational concepts while American students win trivia night but can't really explain why the know something.\n",
      "education is used to separate and maintain the social classes in the States. Rich only chooses the private to avoid public broken system\n",
      "Schools need to push to hold back students instead of pushing them to a level out of their league until they give up. The students that are showing much slower growth need to be put into an alternative career/life focused school/classes/program.\n",
      "Let's perform it on a positive note. The culture and ecology have to be healthy for starters. Schools have to be safe and secure. It has to be supportive of learning curve for the students. The student must take extreme ownership of the curricula. The subject matters must be based on science. Learning methods must be evidence-based. (Yes, I'm a seasoned STEM teacher by the way).\n",
      "Apologies for not watching the whole video.  As a former student and a parent of students, I know the system was broken long before common core.  I remember in college, my English 1 teacher had to give me a grammar guide, because I was so deficient on the basics--though I did well in English all through school.  I had to take remedial math, because my high school didn't prepare me for college courses--though I graduated with the required credits.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Things have gone down since I was a student, and my kids had schools with very high standards, but very low expectations.  That means there were a lot of advanced classes offered--like calculus--but so many ways to accept failure.  They had to take history and social studies, but only had to PASS one!  The policy of \"No Child Left Behind\" was an additional failure, as it meant no one failed or was held back, even though they wouldn't graduate on time.  Kids were just left in education limbo until they earned enough credits to be ousted.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Too much government involvement means teachers aren't allowed to TEACH!  We have some phenomenal teachers, who are underpaid, with far too much non-teaching responsibility heaped on them.  Schools aren't just expected to educate students.  Now, they've got to feed them, clothe them, teach them manners and how to get along, look out for abuse, deal with all their special needs, (and accompanying IEPs,) head off bullying, deal with allergies and medical conditions, worry about gender identity and sexuality, discipline fairly, deal with \"helicopter parents,\" check the boxes for college prep, and deal with the ever-present worry over school shootings.  \n",
      "\n",
      "With all we're expecting from schools and teachers, it's a wonder anyone goes into this profession, or stays once they see the outlook.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Common core, like No Child Left Behind, is a great idea on paper, that fails in implementation.  My kids went to school at a time when the policy was to insure teachers were well-educated.  There was a push to make them go back to college for additional courses, and they were tested themselves on what they were teaching their students.  It meant even more testing for students--to judge whether their teachers were up to the task.  At the same time, they removed a lot of incentive for teachers to do better--like tenure.  They promoted the best teachers out of the classroom.  They took away teaching assistants due to the costs.  They increased class sizes.  And they started charter schools--which were experimental programs.  \n",

Its a very serious matter that I hope will dramatically change very soon. I adapted to the system and became succesful in the studies but I can tell not in life. Sharing my experience, all the best to you guys\n",
      "When I went to school in the sixties, there was one program, one track, and it all revolved around completing workbooks, memorizing facts and spewing them back in exams, and in addition being judged on academic performance (if memorizing and spewing dates and other facts counts as performance), we were given a grade for \"citizenship.\" A good grade in citizenship meant you didn't give the teachers any trouble: you had learned to go along to get along. A bad grade meant you were Trouble, and got a lot of negative attention from the vice principal. I spent most of school, particularly middle school, in terror of making someone mad, or being different. It was a hateful experience.\n",
      "Thanks, well done Sprouts and the visuals are just amazing. Dewey's theory is certainly viable if there is proper funding for Education. It It is  therefore easier to implement in a private school setting as compared to a public school one. A critic would be: how possible is it to find enough time within the term to implement the learning by doing eg planting and watching plants grow while at the same time covering the required syllabus?.

Most of the teachers teaching at these institutes are IITians, doctors, etc. These coachings provide great facilities to their students, so the results are obvious. There are very few government colleges (of class 11 and 12) in India who actually prepare their students for these competitive exams. \n",

Recently, I joined a Management Trainee Program to compete with other fresh graduate students in order to earn the top 5 spots to be qualified. One of them was a girl that graduated from foreign countries (she spent 3 years in Singapore and one year in Australia) and I can see clearly see the difference between us in term of languages, skills, and knowledge. It’s hard to stay being optimist because in reality students from rural areas in my countries don’t even know how to properly use a computer while those in urban areas ace this skill and other multiple skills since they were young. To my knowledge, one of the possible ways right now is to enrich the English language to the disadvantaged students and also creating high quality educating contents in our own language, namely “Khmer”. Ideally, I hope those students will obtain the proficiency in English language, then study the contents that suit their interests through educational media that vastly available at hand now.\n",

Recalling my dark days in that system, I've always hated it because there was a lot of transcribing homework and memorizing poems and passages. When you fail to remember them, teachers will punish you by transcribing the poems and passages several times.

      "I've been an edtech consultant in Beijing for 7 years. I've also traveled to multiple provinces and smaller tier cities to evaluate and help schools. There are multiple compounding factors as to why education is so subpar yet expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first and foremost factor I would note is the lack of public discourse. This permeates through every part of society, especially education. If you are discouraged or not allowed to question things and people around you, you end up missing a fundamental piece of being a good learner: inquiry and reflection. In education, this comes in the strict form of rote knowledge. Even in history class there's no critical thinking or reflection involved, it just becomes a bunch of facts to remember. \n",
      "\n",
      "The second factor of note is barriers of information. The public does not have (easy) access to a lot of internationally recognized academic content, and even if they did get access, they wouldn't be able to recognize it. On top of that, there are many misconceptions about education which are exaggerated by big businesses such as VIPKids who outright lie to parents about standards and expectations. This causes market distortion, and other smaller business simply pick a recognizable brand name (E.G. Wonders) and say that's their curriculum without any plan how to implement it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third factor is incompetence born from lack of actionable knowledge. As stated in the first point, most of the population's education revolves around rote knowledge and discourages reflection. If you've been taught not to question things your whole life, how can you be expected to teach others with inquiry based experiences and methodologies?  How can you be expected to recognize or create effective content to support those learning experiences? The result usually ends up being copy pasting something they found online that looks good (or fishing consultants like me for free content).\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth factor is lack of foreign talent. There are not enough QUALIFIED teachers to meet demand. The general population would not be able to recognize one either. Many companies hire Russians, call them American, and slap a 200%+ markup on the course. It's up to the unqualified teacher to come up with the content, instruction, and meet the unrealistic expectations the \"decision makers\" (sales people) set for the parents.\n",

      "The final factor is who the decision makers are. Who decides what \"national curriculum\" is? Starting in 2020, private schools have been forced to throw out foreign curriculum and adopt the \"national curriculum\". This top-down decision making only exasperates the situation. It also permeates throughout the society. I've been the unfortunate soul who has to coordinate curriculum development projects with the decision makers of these schools.  Most of these decision makers are unqualified, they're sales people at best.\n",

      "My sons were in Chinese public schools until 8th and 9th grade respectively.  I am French and their mom and Chinese so we thought it was important they at least attended a few years of school in the local system.  Until the 6th grade, the system does work and teaches them importance of hard work.  now, as bi-cultural kids, they were actually considered foreigners which in a way lessened academic pressure but also caused resentment especially for my older son.  From 6th grade onwards, the pressure becomes pointless and is made worse because teachers and schools are incentivized on class results.  the worst of them will not hesitate to try and persuade weaker students to leave.  Bullying by teachers can also occur.  my youngest son went all the way to the zhongkao and got accepted into a top local high school but then asked if he could go to an international school.  he went to a very selective one but probably has only half the workload of his former classmates.\n",

      "- Everything is based on 2 tests:  one in grade 9 and one in grade 12.  These tests are extremely hard but also very narrow and focus on rote learning but do not do enough to help kids develop analytical skills (even if that has improved a bit) - system should be reformed to take equivalent of GPA into account.  this would ease a lot of the pressure\n",

      "There is a little that is learnt in those 5 years to help them transition to higher education.  Yes most of them will have strong language and math skills.  But a lot of it is mechanical.

      "The problem I have with those overly stressful education systems is that I wonder if they actually work and if the students learn effectively through them. What I learned through self-defense practice, and military documentaries is that stress and anxiety seem to decrease your ability to focus, and are not an effective way to learn. In self-defense, instructors increase stress by making you do cardio-based exercises to make your body artificially feel stress (accelerated heartbeat, difficulty to breath, difficulty to focus) only to test your ability to reproduce the technique properly when your focus is the least optimal, but they don't do it for learning purposes. The military seems to do it too in their own way.\n",

      "I found this very interesting, and as someone with ADHD-I, I had a lot of hyperfocused thoughts about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It brought up so many points of interest. With in each of these is the fact that education was built upon the industrial revolution, ADHD is considered an epidemic of our time, and our factory type of education destroys or ability for divergent thinking. From the start of the industrial revolution the idea became that people should work in factories and large businesses. As time went on this idea continued but in a different way. By the 1920's there was a drive towards raising the standards of living. People were encouraged overtime to get out of the cities where they worked, and live in the suburbs in a house, get married and join a standard stereotype where the women stayed home to raise to raise their children and the men went to work hopefully using the education they gained to obtain this idealistic life style.\n",
      "\n",
      "But like he said in the talk, this type of trend doesn't work anymore. Styles of life are so divergent and it's obvious that not everyone can get a high paying job resulting from higher education and all women aren't going to be stay at home mom's and many can't. Actually during the 60's many women questioned their identities and blamed their education for giving them delusions of using their education later in life. And as we see today many people are educated for a different experience than the one they will actually be living.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for ADHD it most certainly exists but is caught up in the confusion of our factory like education and the experience of being a distracted average child. I believe ADHD is both a cause and symptom of behavior, but not always both. Take your eyes for example. You get your eyes tested at a young age because your having trouble seeing clearly, so you get prescription lenses. You now wear these lenses for the rest of your life and often have to upgrade to a stronger prescription. And no one asks why.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one asks why are you like this, how did it happen. Or if they do they say your genetically predisposed to it. Yes and no. You can be genetically predisposed to be more likely to develop many types of conditions, but it depends on the right or wrong conditions being met. Becoming near sighted or far sighted for instance is determined on three factors. Your nutrition, your genetics and your life style. Actually  some people have totally reversed their bad eye sight, by changing their diet and their habits. For instance a child who stays inside all day, watching TV and playing videogames for hours, refuses to eat his vegetables and who's parents or relatives have had glasses, may develope near sightedness.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in relation a child who has been mentally watching TV and playing videogames all day, not spending any time practicing how to use their creativity, exploring their real world, developing interests in things that are natural and not directly stimulating, interacting socially with others around them, making constant decisions, based on logic, real feelings, and experiences, and most importantly practicing natural real motivation skills, in combination with poor nutrition and specific genetics will very likely not develope mentally in the healthiest manner. And it doesn't just go for ADHD. This could be a cause for any mental disability or difficulty. In varying degrees of course. But it is believed that behavior (in any form) is partially learned and partially developed. And by developed I mean the way your brain developed. How your nutrition and your experience shaped the way your brain works.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going back to education you can see why this factory mind set can't work for everyone. As well as when you compair the standard disaplines of our modern education with the arts, you find contradiction. Most people don't understand the arts. Most people wonder how the arts became so chaotic to the point it doesn't make sense anymore. Truth is that area of education evolved, but only by those who pursue it, would understand. A big part of the confusion is this idea of perfection that envelopes the academic world. The A grade is the pinacle of that idea.  Do perfectly in your education and you get an A. \n",
      "\n",
      "Well this doesn't really work in the art world. You still get graded when you do your work and do it well, but school is for practicing the academics. In art you study academics as well, like art history, art Theory, and your use of a medium like drawing or painting. What you don't get graded on is on the things that can't be measured, like your idea, your creativity, and the value of your work. Though in some cases your graded on how well you show a specific idea or use a specific skill. But when it comes right down to it, art isn't about any of this or it can be about all of it. It can be about how others value your work, it can be about how divergent your work seems to be, it can be about how well your work matches a subject, it can be about how well you use methods of design, it can be about what kind of thoughts or feeling it brings up in people, and it can be about how it compairs and is judged among a group of people who hold a specific adjenda or opinion in matters that are or are not artistic or intrinsic (AKA art competition or auction). So in a way it is chaotic to the point people can't make sense of it any more, but it is not inherently measurable and perfected.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the product of ideas. And ideas are valued above all else. And yet in education art is set in a lower bar of importance in all its forms, and is confused with this idea of perfection and conformaty.\n",

      "I've been listening to this guy's speeches all day and it just resonates with me more than anything I have seen in a long time. I was misdiagnosed with adhd in elementary school (this wonderful psychologist actually told me in 5th grade that it was a misdiagnosis so I know). So I spent 5 years believing I had adhd when all I had was this thing called childhood. Eventually in 10th grade I switched to an alternative school and everything Robinson has said regarding alternative schools in his other speeches is spot on. I'm a senior at my alternative school, going to college next year and this school has had a profound impact on me. I'll spare the details, but I just want to confirm that alternative schools are very often the solution and right now what I'm most passionate about is making this education revolution happen and I will do everything in my power to achieve this. I wouldn't have this passion if it were not for my alternative school experience, which inspired learning instead of forcing conformity. \n",

      "I certainly remember being much better at being creative when I was younger, but now that I'm a freshman in High School, I've noticed that I'm much worse at the whole creativity thing. Now, the problem is, I'm being praised. Why? I am great at finding the one answer. I can take tests very well, but am typically not the best at projects. Math is my best subject, English is my worst, where you typically have to write creative essays. I want to be an engineer, so at my school, we have an elective called pre-engineering. It's one of the closest classes to an actual job that's available at my school. And I'm not the best at it. Sure I can do the math required, but coming up with ideas for better designs is hard. I feel that this shows that my education is doing the opposite of preparing me for the future. It's telling me that there's one answer, which is never the case in engineering. I hope that soon enough we can have an education overhaul, and realize that we need to change education.\n",

That's why someone living next door to you can be paying twice as much in taxes to go to a school half as good. This system has been known to disproportionately affect rural and urban school districts and tip in favor of school districts in suburban communities, or those in the Poconos where they have resorts that people own condos at.\n",

      "According to WalletHub the best state in the country for “quality of education” is Massachusetts followed by California, according to research released  (January 21, 2019) by WalletHub. The study was part of WalletHub’s annual ranking of the “Most & Least Educated States in America.” This year’s ranking combined two categories — educational attainment and quality of education — broken down by 20 “relevant metrics.” Massachusetts placed first in both categories followed by California. \n",
      "\n",
      "While the educational attainment category is based solely on the percentage of residents with high school, associates, undergraduate, and graduate diplomas, quality of education includes 16 metrics ranging from quality of public high schools to quality of public universities to educational attainment based on gender and race. Within that category, California follows Massachusetts. Rounding out the top five for quality of education are Florida, Maryland, and Vermont, respectively.\n",
      "I grew up in Mass and the schools were excellent.  That said my kids go to school in Los Angeles and there are some great public schools here. My daughter went to a French immersion public school in Glendale, CA. I felt like she got a pretty amazing and unique education.\n",
      "The closest I got to college was watching the professor on Gilligan's Island. That must put me a few points ahead.\n",
      "I'm from CA and I find this super surprising. While overall our stats suck, when you look at the exceptions, the smart kids here astound me. At Dimanomd Bar I knew this kid who was talking calc 1 as a Sophmore in high school. I also met this Taiwanese girl who was taking data structures and algorithms at 16 and recently got into UC Berkeley. I think while overall our stays suck, our top scholars here can top other scholars. After all, the UC system has some of the most prestigious Universities according to US News\n",
      "would have been nice to see what per student funding was per state as well.  See which states are getting a return for their dollar, or correlation between and funding and results.\n",
      "Nothings wrong with going to college its the fact that we are traditionally taught that we all need to go to college to be successful when in fact college isnt for everyone and especially isn’t the only way to succeed in life.\n",
      "Same people that tell you to go to college are paying debt still from it.\n",
      "How the rich stay rich and poor stay poor.\n",
      "Exactly! As a member of GenX, a lot of us are still paying off our loans but yet are gonna send our kids to do the same thing 20+ years later? I think not. I say this as a person with a bachelor's and masters degree! I encourage young people to get as much education for free or as cheaply as they can. The important thing is OUTPUT. If you produce good work, academic or otherwise, you'll always be in demand. \n",
      "\n",
      "With the internet, people are able to start ALL sorts of income producing ventures without high overhead. You can become a software programmer using tutorials online  and make plenty of money. You can learn a trade with only two years of study via community college. If you've got the mind to start your own company afterwards, THEN get a business degree when you're able to pay as you go. You can learn digital marketing without a degree.\n",
      "My son is a senior in high school this year. He says he might choose community college but doesn't want a 4 year university. Trade school is fine too. I think he just doesn't know what he wants to do with his life yet and that's okay. I went to college and spent 12 years paying it off just to decide later that social work was not for me. I don't understand why kids have to rush into a lifelong career when they haven't even had the opportunity to live life yet. I want my child to explore different career paths before he chooses one. I'm in no rush to kick him out. All I ask is that he works or goes to school. I don't want him to be out on his own until he has money saved in the bank and a stable job. I want him to know how to budget and manage his finances properly. I don't want him to struggle living paycheck to paycheck trying to make ends meet. He can go to college anytime if he chooses to do so. There's no age limit.\n",
      "As a millenial I cant help feeling like we were the experiemental group with university somehow. How much could colleges charge and get away with? How far can they upsell this idea of helping people get better jobs by going in debt for the rest of their lives? Its ridiculous that celebrating paying off student loans is even a thing in the first place. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now that the next gen has seen the effects, they are only taking logical next steps to ensure their own security. Universities is just way too expensive...on top of that, theres cost of housing and food and transportation. If it were more affordable, I truly believe more kids absolutely would go.\n",
      "\n",
      " BUT if someone in that position asked me for advice I would always advise them to at least complete community college and 2 year degrees or certification programs at the very least, in a practical field. Many include internships that have great potential to lead to decent jobs.\n",
      "I find this so awesome. I hope these colleges are FORCED to significantly drop their prices. They sucked American students dry. Crippled an entire generation of millennials from being homeowners and ever building financial security. Now it's finally coming to a head and it's long overdue. I hope students find great jobs and stay out of debt.\n",
      "I started my career in the food industry as a shelf stocker at a grocery store. Then was promoted to Merchandiser then to a Buyer. A vendor later asked me to join them doing sales. Fast forward to today I’m 36, still doing sales but now in the seafood industry, and make about $150k gross annually. Not bad for someone that didn’t go to college. Find what you’re good at and work hard at it. College isn’t for everyone.\n",
      "This was inevitable.  University tuition kept skyrocketing over the past 20 years. Tuition has greatly outpaced both inflation and incomes for college-aged students. \n",
      "\n",
      "The entire Millennial generation became de facto indentured servants from their college debt. Basically financial slaves to their debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Education can be very useful for employment goals, but there are limits. And we are approaching that limit from a cost to value perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generation Z is not stupid and they are declining to voluntarily set themselves up for a lifetime of paying back student debt. (Trust me, Gen Z:  you do not want to find yourself in that situation. It will steal years, if not decades, from your life. And you will never get that time back.) \n",
      "\n",
      "Also most skills of the high demand and lucrative software engineering tech jobs are not taught in college, but rather can be learned just as easily by anyone with a cheap internet connection and sufficient motovation/focus. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's common for software developers to earn 6 figure salaries with no college at all.  Companies do not care where you went to school or even of you went: they only care if you have the skills that can help solve their business problems.  How you go about acquiring those skills is totally irrelevant. The company doesn't care if you learned to program Java at college or on your own.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's high time that universities start to feel the sting to their annual profits as more 17 and 18 year olds wake up and push back on the cost of attending college.\n",
      "They are smart to opt out. I've been going to school my entire life. I'm 48 and enjoy learning. There is no difference between high school and community colleges. There is also no guarantee you will find work with a degree. Just because you have a degree doesn't mean your work is good. Professors will rarely tell you if your portfolio is good because they don't care. The institution they work for already have their money. Technical colleges used to be different but they too are falling into the hands of CEO executives who think they know how to run a college. Colleges also don't let teachers teach. The price of education is NOT worth it. You get a better education from the University of Youtube, which most teachers use to teach.\n",
      "when education becomes a business instead of a right, this is what happens.\n",
      "Well, let's consider this most nations give FREE college to their citizens here in the U.S. however we charge them to attend colleges that would make our nation more educated and more adept at high-skilled jobs. It's almost like we want our population to suffer while we are going threw an economic crisis, but hey let's ignore that completely right...\n",
      "Instead of being mad 'cause people only know this song because of GTA, you should be glad today's games show great music to the new generations.\n",

      "My son was playing GTA...I was like, you listen to hall and oates? Worlds collided that day\n",
      "Thank gta for putting some classics on the radio, hits different when your cruising down the highway and this comes on.\n",
      "If you don't like Hall and Oates then you probably don't like music.\n",
      "When this was released in 85  I was in high school and I loved it! I'm here in 2019 still loving it just as much. Oh how I wish we could go back to the 80s. Best time ever!\n",
      "Daryl Hall...what a voice!\n",

      "If you allow young people to be inquisitive, creative and self-reliant, they will educate themselves throughout their adult lives. Childhood should be seen as a sacred phase of development and education as a means of the individual to empower themselves, as and when they choose to; not a punishment to be inflicted upon the unwilling until they are ready to enter the ranks of workers, bureaucrats and managers.\n",
      "Is no one gonna point out that Russell's a way better moderator than 99% of journalists and academics that interview him nowadays?\n",
      "Russel Brand did a really good job here.   He made the interview light and enjoyable, and at the same time probed Yuval to go deeper into his ideas than I've seen him go in other interviews.\n",
      "It seems to me that the purpose of life is to contribute to Society, and do good things. And the purpose of education is to learn how to interpret and understand the World. Students need to learn the \"language\" of the World. They need a good, solid, understanding of the basics. Then they can adapt to anything, and be better prepared to contribute.\n",
      "Oh how I love Russell Brand. Listen to him praise the students for the quality of their questions. He is such a great example of raising each other up!\n",
      "\"You know philosophers are very very patent people,they can argue for thousands of years about some ethical dilemma without resolution.\"🤣🤣🤣\n",
      "To become a self-guided learner: start with Plato's dialogues on education. How do you know what you need to know, until after you've learned it? How can you tell what is true? These were considered crucial questions then, that needed urgent answers.\n",
      "Thanks for this. It's so relevant and I heard some excellent questions and I liked the way they were answered and how sometimes Brand translated or summed up Harari's answers. It made things even more clear and focussed than the talks and interviews I had watched and read in the past little while. The audience was fabulous and asked the best questions ever.\n",
      "Great discussion! Thank you. Yuval said early in his talk that we should look to our governments to ensure that the youth of today receive the kind of education they need to survive in the future. I would suggest that national politicians are likely to be the future 'useless people'. My government (in Africa) has done nothing to help the people. All it has done is line the pockets of the politicians. Education is already being re-engineered today by the private sector - Udacity, Coursera come to mind. There are huge changes taking place through these and other similar organisations and their association with universities around the world. So the future of the youth of today depends on THEM. Thomas Friedman in his book 'Thank You for Being Late' suggests that the previous 'digital divide' between the educated and the lesser educated has gone and the new divide is the Motivational Divide. The youth of today need to be intrinsically motivated (and overcome the natural laziness that Yuval tells us about) and learn, and keep learning. What they need to know is WHAT to learn, then learn it with the help of the Internet, organisations like Udacity, Khan Academy, Coursera and coaches and mentors (teachers in the world of yesterday). Schools also need to embrace these changes.\n",
      "Coming to this in 2020 - isolated and away from my kids thousands of km away.....My son chose to read Theology. I had read Law, Politics and Economics and retain a keen interest in these areas. I had discouraged his choice and questioned it. I was probably wrong.\n",
      "\"India is a country of a billion people but...\" if anyone ever says that stuff again ask them what is the addressable market for their product and watch the fun. I'll bet my money ~99% of these so called entrepreneurs don't know how big their market actually is that's why they can never convert their company into conglomerates.\n",
      "I've started company twice, once when in college and again internationally. I noticed that India largely emulates the US way of doing things. In reality we should follow the UK model. That means unit economics first and market dominance next and not vice versa.\n",
      "really value of an IIT or IIM is not in their curriculum, it's in the students who get into these institutions after beating lakhs of people.\n",

      "They are as insightful if not more\n",
      "You never disappoint ❤️\n",
      "Masters Union cannot replace institutions like IIM or IIT because of the sheer fact that MU does not have to comply with the guidelines of a college or a university. Indian colleges or Universities don't have any place in the top institutes of the world (and rightly so) but something that an IIT or IIM has to deal with that none of the other institutes in the world deals with is the implementation of the reservation policy.\n",
      "Because of the implementation of reservation, there is a possibility that a huge chunk of the people who get into IIMs and IITs be lacking in certain core subjects (Dont assume I am a casteist because I am outlining a drawback in reservation policy. I completely support the reservation policy and every caste is now enjoying the benefit of reservation) and so the faculty of these institutions have to compensate for this drawback and this becomes a huge stepback in achieving wonderful things within a span of 200 years but, the reservation policy gives students from poor and rural backgrounds who haven't had access to great education in their schools/colleges an access to great education when it comes to their higher education. But in an institution like Masters Union (going by their fees structure and the absence of any deferral of fees payment or scholarship) the students generally come from priveleged backgrounds, who have had access to great education since kindergarten. While Masters union assures great education, institutions like IITs and IIMs, ensure social equity and great education\n",

      "Great tips! I also tell my students to chill on Fridays! If you train for a marathon, why would you run a full marathon the day before your race? Same goes for your brain! I also like that you mentioned learning from your mistakes. The key is to make sure you go back over your practice! I tell my students to not write the correct answers and go back and re-try the problems they missed to see if they can get the right answer the second time around. Thanks for the video :)\n",

I get the value in it but I actually say the opposite to my students because they get so stressed out. I tell them not to worry and just relax in there because they can always take it again!

      "Question, is there a specific reason why you recommend taking the SAT twice? I heard a lot that getting a 1500 or above is a mark that, for example, colleges don't look too deeply into whether you got a 1500 or 1540 (Not too big of a deal). So if I were to get a 1500 the first time, should I really take it again?\n",

      "-Compare the quote to the first question’s answers\n",

      "-Try to be engaged/to have fun\n",
      "-Read challenging books beforehand\n",

The most frustrating part about the SAT is that unless you're at an advanced level in math or above the \"normal\" level for your grade, there's a high chance you won't understand or even recognize over 50% of the material and questions. The first time I took it I barely understood a lot of the math on it because I wasn't even completely through Algebra 2. \n",

      "How long did overall raising your score by 200+ points take you? How many hours did you spend per week? Any tips on how to balance school, extracurriculars, and studying for the SAT?\n",
      "My tip: if you know you’re taking the ACT, study for that FIRST! The timing of the ACT is much faster so if you study hard and get used to it, the SAT will seem like a piece of cake! (At least that’s how it was for me)\n",
      "Honestly, for me at least, knowing that there will be another opportunity really relieved my test anxiety and I ended up with a much better score than I predicted!\n",
      "That’s so funny… we got the EXACT same first two SAT scores (1190 and 1360)! Hoping that’s a good sign, and through hard work and dedication, there will be a 1510 in my future!!\n",
      "I took it at the end of my sophomore year and got a 1310. Just took it again 2 months into junior year and got a 1400. My Superscore is a 1440 combining my 2 tests. Hoping this video helps me reach the 1500 I want by the end of my junior year.\n",

      "Thanks for sharing! I am really glad you put this video in the context of what schools the student is looking to apply to, since SAT scores are all relative. Since I score a 1500+, it blows my mind to think about being in the top 99%. I think the part about scores being inflated because schools don't have to report bad test scores since students aren't submitting bad tests scores makes sense. However, I do tell my students that submitting scores is beneficial to them if they can because the U.S. World News Report requires a school to report at least 50% of its students' scores in order for them to remain competitive in the rankings. Thus, more elite schools will take more students with scores than without to maintain their coveted spots!\n",
      "Hi Brooke! I've been watching your videos for a while and was able to score a 1560 as a junior!

Back to the point, id like to say thank you because right now I’m a freshman and I didn’t really have a motivation to study for the act but when I was scrolling through tik tok I saw a video with a really hard math problem but you made it seem really easy like I could do it in a minute so after that I did more research and found out how important the act really is so I’ve been studying with your YouTube and tiktok videos along with other things on the side, i still have 2 years before I have to take it but your videos are so entertaining they make me want to learn and get better at math.\n",

It is so interesting seeing all of these people a few years behind me talk about stats, scores, and extracurriculars. Yale and other elite schools can really and truly set you up for life. But just remember, if your scores aren’t this amazing or you don’t get into your dream school, you still have a wonderful life ahead of you. I’ve taken classes at community college, public universities and private universities, and your education really is what you make of it. College is only a few years out of the rest of your life, and I wish in high school I had known that and spent more time making memories and less time worried about my GPA. Just my two cents, and amazing that all of these students are so accomplished at such young ages!\n",

      "As fun as these videos are, I do want to give a certain amount of warning to HS students. Just because you have the grades, scores, letters of rec, essays, and extracurriculars doesn’t mean you’ll be accepted into these schools. I was denied to all of my colleges despite having a 3.8/4.23, a 1490, and being on a nationally recognised robotics and rocketry team. I even did robotics research in HS at a university, applied to the university, and then was denied from that university. So much of it is just an arbitrary lottery, it’s hard to truly know.\n",

      "This is unknown territory for me. It's fascinating. I dropped out of high school in 10th grade due to multiple reasons, but mostly due to feeling overwhelmed and lost without any guidance. I'm proud of these kids cause they don't all come from privilege. They worked hard.\n",
      "I like watching these videos cuz they do be inspiring me to continue my college education. In highscool I was a 2.0 gpa student. Barely putting the effort to muster a C. My only way getting into college was soccer but eventually I quit due to mental health. I was really depressed and didn’t have any motivation for anything. Had no friends no job and overall I was in a bad state in hs. I just turned 20 now back in community college trying to get a degree eventually gonna transfer. But yeah would’ve wished i had better guidance and wished I could go back and change that so I wouldn’t have made it harder on myself. I didn’t even go to prom no football game nothing and overall had no social life. Starting to change now How I am now and it’s honestly making me a better person and happier. Seeing you guys so happy at Yale is motivation and brings me joy. You guys are very smart and I also admire your hard work you put in and the sacrifice.\n",

That is me, and I can affirm that for many Asian kids, we have an inherent need to do good, make our parents proud (no matter how much pressure we have), and have a high-level job and go to Ivy League schools in order to help support our parents later in life since they spend all of their savings on us. We push for the best because of our work ethic, not because all Asians have \"oh so much money\". For the majority of our parents, as immigrants, it is nearly impossible to imagine the labour, the hard work, the exhaustion, and the prejudice they have faced in the past, all to provide their children with more opportunities. It is not that Asians are inherently smarter, or richer, or more privileged in any ways (although there are those select few), but because of the bitterness we have faced to shape us into who we are today. Asians are no different from others of ethnic origin, to say: Mexicans, African-Americans, Indians, and other \"dis-privileged minorities\" in the States. The only difference is how we choose to approach life and its difficulties. Do we lie down and wait for others to donate things to us or do we choose to fight until the end? I am not trying to start up any racial slurs, cursing, or insultations of any kind, just putting out a thought and consideration for you all. Obviously, there are many successful, talented, and kind people from all ethnic origins as well as bad ones, but I am just making a point here: Why would the high-level universities offer an easier acceptance rate based on race rather than achievement if they did not truly believe in the concept of \"racial preference\" or \"racial advantage\"? Note I put that in quotations, meaning I myself do not think that is a fact. There are hard-working and lazy people, smart and ignorant, good and bad in any race, it is just how we choose to present ourselves and represent our beliefs and race to the rest of the generalising public. So tell me, why should one race get more \"sympathy\" or \"preference\" over another? Can we not just all be equal human beings? It is like saying \"red is better than pink!\" Why? \"Oh, because it is true!\" without an explanation. So, what the lady teacher in the video says really hit me, due to how personal it felt as a 10th grade Chinese girl, and I wanted to share the truth to everyone. Thank you for understanding with an open heart and mind and hopefully, we can all start changing society little by little, with messages like this! No enmities I hope! :)\n",

Even if this is true there are so many ways to combat this with still making sure that there is no cheating. This is especially true in the math section where y literally have to change numbers because the concepts that you are testing should be the same or relatively similar.

Nevertheless, if I do decide to take this time to apply and commit to this dream that has grown on me in the past few years, I’d have to eliminate one of my options, whether USP in Brazil or EPFL in Switzerland due to the amount of time set into both. \n",
      "While balancing my studies for the local admissions test(Fuvest-USP), the EPFL’s entrance exams in French, and a few EC’s, I obtained a couple of 1550+ scores at home following all the procedures as time-monitored tests. I judge my English as near-fluent since I have been taking classes since I was 9. Above all, I have a strong passion for physics, mathematics, and technologies(mainly AI related to physics research).\n",

I acknowledge and feel this excitement for applied maths and physics pushing me to possibly pursue a career in academia and live I life I won't regret, however, I awfully believe that my extracurriculars aren't good enough for top 20 schools and I'm inclined to study in epfl where id have an amazing education, but entirely different from what I've expected as the holistic formation to some eclectic interests that I also have in history and art. \n",

A fantastic sequel to this would be 46 easiest SAT math problems because the easy ones show up more often, and you can still get them wrong if you use the wrong approach. I am not looking to get a perfect score. So, my goal is to focus on getting the easy/medium ones correct and salvage some of the more difficult ones. However, I know I am not the only one who is frustrated with getting 'easy' problems incorrect on the SAT. Therefore, this would be an excellent video for those looking to be in the 600-700 range for the math section, rather than 700-800.\n",

My very first time taking the SAT I get 23 wrong in the Writing Section. However, at khan academy, in the last practice test that I take, I'm getting 33 rights with frequency, which makes me really happy! After that video, I finally understood some keys concepts, such as semi-colons, which I'm sure can give me more 3,4 rights! I'm going to take my second, and last SAT on this saturday, so I'm studying hard to do well and get some financial aid. Thanks teacher, sure you had been helping a lot of teenagers, and now I'm one of them.\n",

      "Truly inspiring video. The presentation is truly flawless, and the few frames of Minecraft gameplay captures the essence of the game. I love how you used pocket edition, because its unique and different than most Minecraft videos being published today using PC or console versions of the game, and I really think this choice sets you away from the others and makes you stand out. Also the landscape presented in the few frames really captures the urgency of the situation and how you want to hold on to the game as long as possible before you give in to the urge to scratch your testicles. I really love the decision to be in a gray cobblestone base, as the gray really gives a feeling of sadness as you will only be able to play the game for so little time before needing to submit to the feeling of discomfort in your testicles only able to be relieved by scratching them. Also the choice to place torches in the shelter symbolizes the small time you have hope to keep going even though the situation seems tough and the darkness is surrounding. If you observe the items the player is holding during the gameplay, we can find that the player is holding a torch, just like the many around his shelter. This means the torches around the base has just been placed, and shows how you can move forward in life, no matter how dire the situation may seem. In the other hand you can find a stone sword which symbolizes the battle needed to resist the constant suffering of feeling a slight skin discomfort in the testicular area, and how much you can fight through it and do your best no matter what. Also the usage of a sword in shelter holds a really deep meaning, showing how even if someone is in their home, they are never safe of the dangers outside, and that they always should be careful and attentive of their surroundings to ensure their safety. I also appreciate the 4 chests in the form of a rectangular shape, which shows the balance of a mans possessions and how you need to hold on to all you have because you never know if something might happen requiring you to exit the software due to an unforgiving feeling in the balls. Not to mention the way the player looks out the exit, as if the player is looking out into the giant world around them, thinking of all they could accomplish and how they might get there, and how even though you may be small compared to the universe, the impact you make can change the world. Another very symbolic part of this film is the ending, where the player thanks everyone for viewing his video even though it took the viewer though a lot of ups and downs emotionally but they still stayed through to the end to show support for the player's dedication. It also is in a slightly smaller frame, and black bars replace the outer edges, which show that even though you try your best, there is still endless uncertainty on how your choices impacted your journey, and how much different it could have been if you have done something different, which creates a paradox of endless possibilities which could have spiraled out of one simple task of playing the game of Minecraft as long as possible, without itching ones testicles. The background is blue behind white text which shows how the creator felt \"blue\" or sad about ending, but still proud of what they accomplished, and is hopeful for what is to come.\n",

      "When I was in elementary school, back in the 70's, I was reading my way through my school's sci-fi section. It was just a few shelves, but it had almost all the classics... Asimov, Bova, Bradbury, Campbell, Clarke, Doc Smith, Heinlein -- and then I got to Verne. I'd just finished up 30,000 Leagues and was getting into Journey to the Center of the Earth when I found a page had been ripped from the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being a good student, I reported it to the Librarian... but instead of focusing on the missing page, she was outraged that I was reading this particular book. It was \"above my level\" she said, and \"too difficult\" for me. This was a hundred-year-old story at this point, and I was pretty sure it wasn't a difficult one to follow -- the movie was even one of my favorites every time it aired on Creature Feature on Saturdays! But she still took the book away... and over the next few weeks, that sci-fi section became empty shelves as she removed and locked away almost all the books there.\n",
      "\n",
      "A short time later, I overheard her talking to another teacher about, of all things, a \"shooting star\" -- a meteor that many had seen a night or two before. The Librarian was mocking the teacher because \"a shooting star is impossible -- the Heavens are permanent! The stars don't move!\" As the teacher tried to explain the idea of a meteor, it seemed to both terrify and outrage her. And the longer that conversation went on the more even I (maybe 10 or 11 years old at the time?) realized -- the sci-fi books she had removed weren't above MY level, they were above HER level. She had no understanding of science, and all these sci-fi stories about starships, robots, and alien worlds were things that she just didn't understand... and because of that, they scared her, so she locked them away.\n",

My point being, more students will now read these books than before banning them.\n",
      "When one parent doesn't want their child to read a certain book they can fill out a form so no child in the school can read it. That sounds more like indoctrination than education.

You did a great job in not only explaining the concepts but setting it up to where one can intuit all the components and and concepts that goes into the applications of it all. Thanks so much, I feel like I can really help my students with their digestion of these concepts and rationalization of it! Thanks you so much for taking the time to teach these concepts!\n",

      "Having done a lot of diving - I can say that the octopus is an absolute marvel to encounter. Some (mostly the younger ones) are ... So curious. At first it's like \"WOW! U THREAT?!\" once it establishes that you are not, it's like \"Eeer ... What are you then? I've never seen one of you around before.\" and there begins the act of mutual curiosity :3. You slowly reach with a finger, it sends a tentacle ... you both touch, sometimes they get frightened and clamp your entire hand, flashing black before letting go, but not swimming away. They are playful, find a shiny pebble, hand it to the octopus, it'll take it, check if it can be eaten ... discard it ... then a few sec after send a tentacle back to the pebble out of curiosity as to \"why did he give me this pebble ... gotta check again for anything special\". They really hold a very special place in my heart, it's not everyday that two species get curious about one another and attempt mutual understanding :)\n",
      "I worked with a marine biologist studying cephalopods. He had one big tank for octopuses and one for crabs, their favorite food. One morning he came in and found that one of his octopuses had pushed the lid open on his tank, crossed the floor and climbed into the crab tank. Soon it became a common occurrence. He decided to give the octopus a mild shock when he found it in the crab tank to deter it. Within days he came in and found the octopus had still gone to the crab tank, eaten it's fill, but then climbed back to its own tank to avoid the shock.\n",
      "They are amazing animals.\n",
      "My favorite creature ever.  I was on a crab ship in Russia.  I was the green horn so I had to empty out the pots.  I was also making hooch quietly because it was forbidden (it was lighting in a cup) so I could swap liquor with the chef for him making me private meals.  One day there was an octopus in a crab pot.  I tossed it a live well. Came back once everyone was off the deck.  Was gonna take it to the chef. it softly wrapped itself around my arm and I felt like I could see the fear in its eyes.  I couldn't do it.  I took it over to the side of the ship, held it over.  It looked down, looked back at me, let go of my arm, and worked its way down the side of the ship until it got to the water.  AMAZING CREATURES!\n",

The list of animals it's been observed to imitate is quite long (Jelly Fish, Lionfish, Sea Snakes, Zebra Sole, Flatfish, Giant Crab, Sea Horses ect) it has also been recorded imitating at least two species we don't know about (the same shape were recorded in separate locations being used by different individuals).\n",

      "I am very thankful for this presentation, I was afraid I was the only one that was pondering these ideas specifically concerning microbiology. Specifically the ability of bacterium changing their polarity quickly through chemical absorption of charged ions that are easily available through their outer cell wall causing that microbe to move, in a since, chemically. That would explain the speed of its movement as if turning on and off a light. In effect, just by changing of polarity of a biome would move it through time and space while leaving it's structure idle, at its point of origin, but alter the quality of a distant biome into the parent's original quality. In this accomplishing the  quantum speeds. Said energy in itself could then be transferred into movement, pressure fluctuation to force fluid movement or constriction, as well as color change. We see this in octopus or the movement of photophilic  plant cells. Great  discussion.\n",

About 12 seconds of me gawking at it went by before a bigger dragonfly landed on top of the first and proceeded to quickly rip its head off.

As I opened my eyes, a group of five dragonflies that were traveling over the water suddenly stopped in front of my face, hovered there for about 10 seconds, then suddenly did a 90 degree turn in synchronized fashion and continued on their way down the creek.

But orcas have been recorded and seen leading humans towards pods of whales to hunt. They might see humans as a potential symbiotic relationship since they’re known to eat human leftovers from whaling or snag stray fish when fishermen use nets. Just super cool that they easily could attack and kill humans but seemingly have no interest in doing so\n",
      "The Lummi Nation refer to the local orcas as Qwe 'lhol mechen, which means 'our relatives who live under the sea' or 'the people under the waves.' Orcas live in tight-knit families. In most cases, both males and females stay in their natal pod throughout their entire lives (this is especially true for Southern and Northern Residents). Orcas are incredibly intelligent and social. Their limbic system (the part of the brain that processes emotion) is incredibly developed and complex. Each pod uses a distinctive dialect to communicate. They're the only species, besides humans, pilot whales, beluga whales and narwhals, that go through menopause.\n",

      "Orcas really are the humans of the sea. They're everywhere, eat anything, work in groups, have dialects, pass down skills over generations, and have great teamwork skills. If they were humans I would say they are in a sort of \"tribal stage.\" It's only a matter of time before they become advanced one way or another.\n",

      "In my dissertation work, I used the non-fluorescent halves of different fluorescent proteins and engineered expression vectors for genes that encoded these appended to target proteins (wt and oncogenic mutant c-Fes kinases) such that the targets would be competent/functional with the attached FP halves, but then when they bind/dimerize/oligomerize to perform phosphorylation-dependent enzymatic activity, then the FP halves would bind as well to become a whole fluorescent protein tagging the target protein dimers! This approach allowed us to observe the action of our targets, localization, quantify dimerization (as a proxy for kinase function in this case as well), etc. Molecular biology is built upon so many tools/techniques that are in and of themselves amazing!\n",

There was nothing to stitch shut (no skin) and couldn't reattach tip so they used a special material on it for a while.  Removing that was horrifying.  But there isn't even any scar tissue and my finger print grew back too.  However the nerves didn't fair quite as well.

      "Expand to see important notes for this video. 1) This video, as stated in the description, focuses on general functions of biomolecules. The biomolecules: carbs, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, can all can have important functions in the body.  *This is a video about the general function of biomolecules. For your dietary needs, consult with a dietitian or medical doctor.*  2) We mention the popular CHO, CHO, CHON, CHONP mnemonic for major elements in the biomolecules. As we mention, these are basics. There can be more elements (such as sulfur for example in proteins), but we wanted to identify *common elements starting at the building block level.*  At the building block level, *some amino acids lack sulfur* for example. It's not just sulfur. For example, there are lipids that can additionally contain phosphate or nitrogen. The popular CHO, CHO, CHON, CHONP mnemonic sticks with basic elements found even at the building block level. 3) Since this video only uses one character for carbohydrates, one character for lipids, and one character for proteins - unfortunately, when mentioning general functions of each biomolecule type, it isn't designed to show a specific type. We received a great point in an email though that, since our little lipid character is a triglyceride, this can be confusing when naming lipid functions. For example, at 3:52 in the video when saying lipids are part of the cell membrane, it would be much better if we do not show the little lipid character so there won't be any confusion as we do not want to imply that *specific* lipid type makes up the cell membrane. [Phospholipids are a major lipid type in the cell membrane although other types exist as well]. We plan to explore creating individual, detailed videos on lipids, carbs, and proteins where we can show different types.\n",

In 2013, the discovery of a single tooth helped researchers identify a prehistoric platypus that was more than three feet long—double the size of the modern animal.\n",

      "• _They lack a stomach:_ Platypuses (platypodes and platypi are technically also correct, but much rarer in use) aren't the only animals to forgo an acid-producing part of the gut; spiny echidnas, and nearly a quarter of living fishes all have a gullet that connects directly to their intestines.\n",

      "There's a lot more unusual stuff \"under the hood\" of these guys (and their Echidna cousins). Their skeletons for example, have 'epipubic bones' aka \"pouch bones\" which are only found in Marsupials and Monotremes. But more unusual still, they have 3 bones in their pectoral girdle, while ALL other mammals have only two. On a human for example, the pectoral girdle (aka, the bones that link the arms to the rest of the skeleton and make up the shoulder) is made of two bones: the scapula (shoulder blade) and Clavicle (collar bone), with one running to the back and the other linking up at a socket in the sternum. It means that we, like 'all' mammals, can pivot our shoulders around, not just the arms within the socket. Compare this to birds/reptiles and older Tetrapod groups and you'll find that the pectoral girdle is a fused mass just like the pelvic girdle, with two bones at the front that firmly anchor the shoulders in place to the sternum. This third bone is the 'Coracoid' bone, and mammals lost it a long time ago... except in Monotremes. On the plus though, like the rigid flight frame of a bird, it provides a very solid anchor for powerful forelimbs which is why Platypus primarily use their forelimbs to swim (or echidna to dig). Splayed legs, more ribs than other mammals, low body heat,  eggs, venom, etc. honestly make platypus and echidna more like lizards in a furry costume than just a beaver with a duck bill or a pointy-nosed hedgehog.\n",

We have evidence that both crocodilians and dinosaurs could change from warm-blooded to cold-blooded and back again. Birds, being warm-blooded reptiles, show the transition from ectothermic to exothermic lifestyles. Why wouldn't amphibians do the same over the eons in one shape or another?\n",

      "There were several things that were not taken into account when evolving over time.  They stuck way too closely to frog morphology and tried to hammer-fit it into each of the niches.  Amphibians have varied morphology now that were advantageous for land dwelling amphibians but were not mentioned.    Amphibians that become completely terrestrial without need for water as part of their life cycle no longer meet the definition of \"amphibian\".  Every evolved amphibian retained frog eyes and body structure.  Evolution is also influenced by things never mentioned as well.  Predator prey relationships drive evolution.  Fast running prey animals and predictors are an example.  Size also dictates evolution due to environmental factors.  Amphibians respiratory system is a limiting factor as many don't have lungs and breathe by uptake of oxygen through the skin or primitive lungs.  This limits size.  The larger the animal the more oxygen is needed.  That's why lungs evolved.  This would also change mouth and nose shape.\n",

It's kinda hinted their evolution was rapid due to either radiation, science gone wrong, or the lack of mammalian predators. So I wonder what a squid or octo world would be like. Would both evolve simultaneously like the Inklings and Octolings did? Would civilization rise again? I dunno, I wonder what a realistic Splatoon world would be where sealife, specifically invertebrates, evolved.\n",

      "My opinion was always that Wyverns are a type/subspecies of dragon. Saying \"that's not a dragon, that's a wyvern\" is about as useful as saying \"that's not a dog, that's a border collie!\"\n",
      "\"If hippos were carnivores that lit their prey on fire.\"\n",
      "So all the nightmares at once.\n",
      "I like how the \"true dragons\" didn't end up looking like the \"stereotypical\" dragon. Instead they had a very Quetzalcoatl appearance, which makes it believable. As cool as a dragon looking like Draco from Dragonheart would be, I could see a pterosaur-like dragon being more realistic.\n",
      "Have you ever heard of the 1982 animated movie “A Flight of Dragons.” They answer a lot of Dragon biology questions like the fact that Dragons can fly because they are essentially organic hydrogen balloons and they breathe fire to vent it off.\n",
      "I remember a high-school biology project in which we had to create a basic phylogeny graph for dragons, including drawings. It was very fun.\n",
      "I’m surprised there isn’t more dragons with names taken directly from mythical dragons. I could absolutely see Orochi, Gorynych, Lindwurms, Basilisks, Serrushes, Leviathan, Behemoth, Ziz, Python, Ladon, and even to an extent Typhon fitting in well to this family tree.\n",
      "I’d love this as a video game. Create a Skyrim-esque world except where dragons aren’t mythical creatures but wild animals that could have adequate intelligence and small levels of society (like a smart dolphin). I think the approach would be cool bc it could be a mechanism for keeping humans in a medieval age since dragons would prey on cities like wolves on sheep.\n",
      "I actually pondered on how dragons would be able to breath fire and I brought the topic up to my mom. I had the idea that they had to have an organ in their body that would produce a highly reactive gas, or liquid, and that when it was forced out it would either ignite from the oxygen or something else would ignite it internally, which is where my mom got the idea that Dragons would have a crop like chickens have, and throughout a dragons lifetime they would eat rocks of Flint that would go into that crop. When the dragon needed to breath fire that crop would constrict extremely fast while the gas/liquid came up, igniting and sending out flames. The Dragons internals being protecting by a thick, flame retardant, mucus.\n",
      "Since we did dragons, and horse paleontology is so rarely touched on, a unicorn or other myth creature could be another cool video\n",
      "Until a few years ago, I didn't even know about the dragon - wyvern debate. I've always thought (and still do): all wyverns are dragons, not every dragon is a wyvern, just like every duck is a bird, but not every bird is a duck. Dragon is just a broad term for many different creatures. The one with four legs and two wings are european dragons (just my way of thinking, not saying it as a fact...not sure what most people's opinion is).\n",

      " H2O uses a covalent bond: each hydrogen shares an electron with oxygen. It is thus a polar molecule.\n",
      " All water molecules are attracted to each other due to this polarity – these are hydrogen bonds (between the positive and negative poles of different molecules)\n",
      " Hydrogen bonds in water results in high cohesion, and thus high surface tension.\n",
      " Cohesion is the attraction between two like things (e.g. two water molecules).\n",
      " Water has the highest cohesion of any non-metallic liquid.\n",
      " Adhesion is the attraction between two unlike things (e.g. water and glass).\n",
      " Capillary action is water defying gravity.\n",
      " Water is the greatest solvents (due to its polarity). \n",
      " Hydrophilic molecules are polar – their polarity is stronger than the cohesive forces of water.\n",
      " Hydrophobic molecules cannot break the cohesive forces of water because they are non-polar.\n",
      " Solid water is less dense than liquid water due to hydrogen bonds forming crystalline structures that space molecules apart more easily (when frozen).\n",
      " Water has a very high heat capacity – it is good at holding on to heat, thus oceans regulate climate and temperature of planets.\n",

      "Why recreate adversity? I'm definitely part of that sub-group against bonsai - it's crippling trees for just aesthetics and there's also some weird control issues to unpack around it. Just get some plants that are good for your local wildlife.\n",
      "People like to talk about \"torturing\" trees like they don't cut their grass every week.\n",
      "I like the part that bonsai tree can grow big if allowed and can still make fruit/seed... so we could theoretically save endangered giant trees by making bonsais of them and have a hope that one day... there will be place where they can / their offspring can grow big again.\n",
      "There are also natural bonsai, they form in small pockets of soil on certain rock formations and are really rare.\n",
      "So, a bonsai could theoretically become a normal, huge tree when planted elsewhere. But the question is, is a tree “happier” when it grows way bigger? Or is the tree happy when it’s small too? The obvious answer is no, the tree doesn’t care. Another answer would be “we have no way of knowing.” People like to assign emotions to things, but a lot of the time those emotions are just self-reflection. \n",
      "\n",
      "People assign the wrong emotions to animals too, even though we know animals can feel emotion, people still misunderstand them and describe them incorrectly. This happens all the time. \n",
      "\n",
      "So even when we find out trees can experience emotion (and some evidence already suggests this) we would probably still force our own perspective onto them, like we do now.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we do know for a fact is that plants do what they do, with the conditions they are given. Are they “satisfied” being the tree that they are? I don’t think trees know this concept. I think people shouldn’t anthromorphise their idea of “succes and satisfaction” onto plants. In fact, people already project their ideas of success onto other people and animals who don’t need it. The trees definitely don’t need it either.\n",

      "To the people saying that growing bonsais is torture, I just want to say that many of the training methods are also applies in other tree nurseries, where the trees for parks, streets and gardens are grown. They are repotted, pruned (the roots too), wired and they get limited amounts of nutrients in order to grow into the desired shape. Of course, it isn't neccessary to keep bonsais at such a small size when the trees could become much bigger, but as long as they are kept healthy I don't see a problem with it. I think that few wild trees actually have the resources to grow to their full potential, and especially not the ones that grow in urban settings.\n",

      "I'm having rough times lately, feels like giving up at times. This quote really cheers me up.\n",
      "There's no way you could assume that it's doing actual harm to the tree. After all you reassure the plant has got all it needs to survive and actually flourish on a smaller scale since you're eliminating the constant struggle for survival that happens in nature\n",
      "Bonsai are also easier to store than a fully grown tree, so it playes a part in preservation.\n",

And I know I’m just some guy but after reading everything I could get my hands on (that wasn’t written for PHD candidates) it dawned on me that this might be our ticket to the stars.

If one observes a particle (planet) around the nucleus (sun) with a shutter speed equal to one revolution, it would register at one position only; 1/2 cycle would result in two opposite positions. At higher speeds more positions are collected and the vibration (wave) function starts to reveal itself.

      "\n",
      "1. The cane gets stabilized by the fact that the lighter side of the cane gets less friction form Your finger than the heavier side, so that finger moves faster towards the COM of the cane. This causes the effect to flip and the fingers slowly align themselves around the center of mass...\n",
      "2. The phone is not evenly weighed, so spinning it in some axis would make it destabilize, right...? Well, the same effect is observed when spinning a brick (it fell on my foot... twice... while I tested that) that I played around with. I believe this effect occurs because of the fact that the center of mass of the brick/phone is in the middle of the whole object, so rotating it around the axis that allows more mass to rotate around further from the COM will work because the particles far away have to have less momentum, the spin is easier. On the other hand, spinning the phone the other way makes more particles have more energy, so this state is unstable. The phone starts to spin in a way that makes some of the particles decelerate, which is a more stable state (rhyme unintended). The same thing is observed when spinning around and then extending Your hands out, which causes You to decelerate.\n",

      "The reason why #1 works isn’t just because of the method, but because in the first case you only have one finger; the center of mass is always a point, and since you’ve only got one point of contact where your finger touches the cane, there is effectively a 0% chance the center of mass is exactly on that contact point, and thus starts leaning towards one side or another.\n",

      "If you use the second method, there’s two points of contact, and thus as long as the center of mass is in-between, it cannot tilt.

      "#4 might have something to do with the \"4th phase of water.\" It's a relatively newly discovered phenomena that negatively charged particles inside of water seem to cluster close to non-water surfaces. There's a charge-less layer after that and then a layer of positive charge which creates a natural bi-pole which could act as a magnet when stimulated with another magnet and basically push the cereal along (and possibly even as work as a battery as the scientist explaining it pointed out). I'm no expert obviously, but there was a Ted talk that I watched on Youtube on the topic which was fascinating. I suggest you look it up.\n",
      "First one works thanks to friction, when the imbalance occurs friction cancels out the speeds on each side which kind of forces you to move them accordingly so that the momentum on the sides are equal.\n",
      "On the first one it works because when your hand is closer to one side, the friction slows it down on each side until when your fingers meet and the object is balanced. This should work as long as each hand is moving at relatively the same speed, the same force, and there isn't any other significant variables.\n",

Seeing as this is something of an epistemological framework (I like epistemology and they're important for getting new perspectives), and there's a functionally infinite expansion of the number of ways a complex system can evolve, I'm struggling to see how we're going to find this needle in a haystack of can's and can't's. That is, without lots and lots of ways to generate new ideas about how the system will evolve and new razors for eliminating impossible actions.\n",

That, I have long believed is nonsensical without mention of relative rates of time layering.  I note that Feynman's QED is not actually sensible, explanatory, or even rational but only exquisitely descriptive.  This vid also illuminated for me, the ubiquitous ‘hairiness’ of the universe as a thick tangle of ER/EPR entanglement ‘filaments’ stretched in at least 4D by an infinitude of time sheared partners.  I think this makes the universe a relatively big, but very tiny place.\n",

And I think I have discovered something that I feel I should go public with as soon as possible. I've never written a book before... It is intimidating... And one day, I hope to have your blessing.

You could have even talked more about the scientist+civilians \"sacrificing\" or loosing their lives after doing experiences with new inventions etc. Many lives were lost due the lack of safety issues back in the days or just due to not knowing all the side effects etc. Excellent job Suzie. I am very amazed by your work and by your wisdom.\n",
      "What a fantastic journey through the discovery of physics..... Fascinating! Well done Suzie for making a difficult subject to understand so accessible. Frankly, I didn't think that this would be an easy watch, but it was well explained and your excitement for science is quite infectious. I'm looking forward to reading your book. Excelsior!!!!!!!\n",
      "Outstanding lecture. Interesting and fun. Thank you.\n",
      "Truly a remarkable presentation!! I read probably my most highly inspirational book by my newfound role model, Fundamentals: The Ten Keys to Reality by Frank Wilczek who he references experiments as well as other interesting findings in this presentation. There’s also the book, QED The Strange Theory of Light and Matter by Richard P. Feynman which this video helps me visualize the x-rays excitements.\n",

I got way too excited about it and felt silly. I'm a 30 year old woman, and I wanted to have these sheets myself to explore these patterns, they're beautiful. I knew there was something to it, and this video makes me very, very happy! Can't wait to see more from this research and channel, I'm a new subscriber.\n",

Is the moon there when we don't look at it, read about object permanence in psychology for instance. There are many other interesting correlations like this which may shed some light on observation. We are reaching the limit of being able to discern what is novel with what could be attributed to another already agreed understanding even if the correlation is not obvious. Even our inherent bias may get in the way, and like any puzzle, such as a sadoku, we may eventually learn that the complex mathematics could be on the wrong track and have to be scrapped only to have to start basically from some previous branch no matter how far back, and finally, it seems we are fast running out of feasible experiments to confirm or deny the predictions made by quantum mechanics.\n",

      "I had, and experienced, this same experiment in a high school physics class in 1959 as we studied pendulum motion. The teacher of that class was a PhD physicist taking a two year sabbatical from a national lab. His demonstration also included a lesson in the difference between what we say and what we believe. Each of us sat on a high stool as a shotput suspended from the high ceiling by a cable was brought up to within an inch or two of our nose. He asked each of us, \"Do you know the laws of pendulum motion.\" Our response was of course \"Yes.\" Then just as he released the shotput he said, \"Know we will see if you believe them.\" Most, but not all sat still as that eight pounds of lead rocketed back towards our noses. Only a few ducked away a the last second. That was 63 years ago. I remember it like it was yesterday. Sadly, today that teacher would not be able to do that experiment (or any of the other amazing things he did in that classroom.) The lessons are to structured, preprogramed, and rigid for creative teachers to inspire the young minds and imaginations of their students. Plus the specter of liability would be the death of any imaginative and creative teaching.\n",

If i saw this video 5 years ago I would have understood that fact earlier. Thank you for this clear and neat explonation.\n",

We need more people like him, who is curious and ask the right questions. He truly knows where the black spots are in our knowledge. He points them out clearly. We are watching a genious of our time. 200 years from now he will be known because he was one of the few who understood how little we know and where we should look\n",
      "Wow! I am so glad I discovered Dr. Penrose today. I wanted to refrain from any comments, but I have to say that the Interviewer asked better questions than Dr. Peterson and he seemed to understand what Prof. Penrose was meaning, whilst Dr. Peterson's brain seemed to short-circuited a few times. My view is that Dr. Peterson came in with an upfront agenda, not to learn but to convince. Kudos to Prof Penrose for schooling Dr. Peterson. Okay, I said enough.\n",

It was sad to witness. Sir Penrose is 90 now (almost 91) and he talks about stuff in a very clear way which most adults aren't able to do. Amazing.\n",
      "It’s crazy to see Dr Jordan Peterson learning. When I see him in videos, I just assume he knows everything already, like he just has a flash drive plugged in somewhere.\n",
      "Dr. Peterson, there is another physicist (turned philosopher) who wrote a lot about the nature of the mind and of consciousness, basing himself in his understanding of physics. His name was David Bohm. He is now deceased, but he wrote a book called \"Wholeness and the Implicate Order\" in which he discusses several things which might be relevant to this conversation, and which I found very enlightening. I recommend it to you. And while you're at it, you might as well also look into his interpretation of quantum mechanics, called Bohmian mechanics, since you showed interest in quantum theory. His interpretation gets rid of the inconsistency/incompleteness from which the standard interpretation suffers in an elegant and easy to understand way, and in a way which takes all of the apparent \"magic\" out of the theory.\n",

      "On my channel are a series of ion propelled aircrafts that are patented specifically for lifting their power supplies against Earth's gravity.  They can fly with no moving mechanical parts.  They create a downdraft with solid state electronics that is sufficient to propel them upwards.  They don't defy physics though, rather they rely on well-known physics.  It used to be that ion propulsion could not lift its power supply from the ground. There are more than 40 public videos of the craft.\n",
      "Amazing video thank you! Yes, atomic motion is perpetual. Mass changing its position in space = motion. Perpetual? Well for most of us billions of years is long enough. So, examples of perpetual motions (does not factor in wear and tear of the device); solar panels, water mills, wind mills, geo thermal (Iceland), John Bedini generator which uses a drive battery that looses only a few milliamps while the charging battery gains hundreds of millivolts (I personally recharged hundreds of batteries, with carefully measured results)... The physics here at play is to not be stuck to one view, one device and what it does by itself. Yes that's being confined to thermodynamics. However, look outside the box for energy source (solar panels obtain their energy not from photovoltaic panels, but from the sun). Thermodynamics is true in CLOSED or ISOLATED systems. Nitinol is also overunity (which perpetual motion is a part of) using cold and hot water to activate it cyclically.  The most abundant phase of matter in the universe is plasma (an electrically charged - ionized gas). Well, a lot of energy could be pulled out of these stellar gas, and they will be energized until the end of time by stars. Are we introverted into a small device set in motion, or are we scientifically, logically looking at the big picture? As long as we stay stuck in a boxed-in frame of reference, we don't progress. Every advances made was possible by women and men who dared looking at things holistically, from all points of view. Cheers!\n",

      "The trouble with the holographic notion is POV (point of view) on the one hand and photon density on the other, …… then if we had three or more hands all of the substance that can’t be “projected” and of course light speed. Having said that, I do agree that all of the forces are actually expressions of the same phenomenon, that being the interaction of matter energy with the Higgs Field at the plank scale. To my thinking this interaction elevates the energy level of the field proportional to the interacting mass and this is gravity the energy level of which creates the effect of the curvature of space. So that is another effect that cannot be projected as a hologram.\n",

      "What would it look like if we met the extent of the knowledge God allowed us to know? It would be like we were contained inside of a realm, like a bubble and so one part of the bubble is connected to the next part of the bubble and it is all connected but we can never know what is outside of the bubble to know how the bubble truly works because we can never be outside the bubble. When pressed against the bubble we can see a bit ways outside of it to see that we are inside a bubble, like finding balance between the left and right side of a bicycle. God set limits of the ocean and of the mountains and of the thickness of our skin and since He will always know more than us He has set limits on what we are allowed to know. But it is a good thing to flesh out all the areas we are allowed to know to make use of them.\n",

The sun produces a lot of energy, and similar to humans a tree needs to protect himself from sunlight. Think about how hot it gets at solar noon, and the fact that the tree needs to sit in direct sunlight for the entire day. The tree is literally cooling itself down through evaporative cooling, similar to how humans do it through sweating. This process is known as evapotranspiration.\n",

      "I’m a refrigeration technician, and I realized a while back that the water evaporates out of the bottoms of the leaves to refrigerate them, when water evaporates, the vapor pulls heat from the remaining source water, cooling it. This is necessary because sunlight has the potential to heat the leaves beyond the temperature they can still function for photosynthesis.\n",

I'm glad you mentioned induction, if one dives into program verification, you'll see that induction is essential to doing any kind of proof because induction corresponds to recursion in programming. Induction on the natural numbers may not be interesting, but think about induction on your data types and proving properties about them.

I just completed my bachelors of computer science at a university, and basically programming is not being taught to you (just very very minimally). You are expected to do learn it yourself on your own (and everyone does so anyways). It is more a tool that you use for other courses, than what you are learning towards.\n",
      "I had a lot of theoretical courses in maths, theoretical computer science (complexity theory), technical computer science (Transistors and stuff), and practical computer science (Algorithms and Datastructures). You can use your programming skills everywhere to solve tasks, and that is the beauty of it.\n",

      "If I may suggest a video idea: you could do something similar to this but about frameworks, libs, deployers, package managers, compilers, git, docker and all that other tools and weirdly named-stuff that comes with learning a language, because as a beginner all those names are really overwhelming  😥\n",

      "5:40 Another advantage of two's complement is that addition, subtraction, and multiplication on it are simpler. You just do the same as with unsigned values. One way to explain that is using modular arithmetic: unless you use long arithmetic, numbers are computed modulo 2 to the power of the number of bits in an integer, and the numbers that the same bit string represents in unsigned types and in two's complement are equivalent\n",
      "What a well laid out video! I'm starting a master's programme in CS at the end of the month after graduating as a BSc in physics, and this video really helped in assuring myself that I'm not in over my head and am actually surprisingly familiar with the topics to come. Of course, I don't mean to underestimate the amount of work to come, but at least I'm more confident now.\n",
      "3:55 - Not really, C++ is much more complex than C, you have the standard template library(STL), templates (check std::enable_if for example), different methods of casting (C-style cast, static_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast), RTTI (run time type information), concepts and constraints (some kind of traits) (concept and require keywords), range-based for loops, rvalues and lvalues, lambda expressions, std::launder (I don't know what \"memory laundering\" is), and more.\n",

      "Computer Science gives you a language to communicate your technical ideas as well as a framework and tools to evaluate them. And while you can learn programming/development by watching a bunch of Youtube videos, if you lack the basic CS knowledge, you will always struggle to make technical choices & come up with a poor/suboptimal design.

      "When I started in Computer Science I was surprised how many of my classmates didn't even like to code.  They saw programming as at best a steeping stone to their real career.  My CS coursework certainly never taught me much programming.  My best teacher was my library of Plum Hall books.  In my case a professor liked my code and recommended me as a research assistant which was my first computer job.  The position was supposed to go to a CS grad student and I was an undergrad music major.  My research areas were mainly data compression and pattern recognition.  I was within a stone's throw of finishing my music degree when I realized that I met the requirements for a CS degree so I ended up graduating with a CS major, music minor even though I had 3 times as many hours in music as CS.  In my case I didn't program for long. Even though I enjoyed coding my bigger interest was systems and that is the direction I went after graduating.\n",
      "TechLead this is a fantastic video, very well done. In my experience as a physics major with a minor in math and computer science. I found that there are classes in every major that use computers and computer programming extensively. In math we used programming to model complex physical systems that you could never do with out numerical analysis.  In physics we had a year lab where we made our own high speed data capture card.  We programmed it to capture data and then we wrote programs to analyze and display that data. I think you are 100% correct when you state that the act of programming is very important for every discipline.\n",
      "I was really under a lot of stress and pressure to pursue a masters degree and I was thinking of doing a computer science degree since I had a bachelors in it too. But just like you said, apart from 1 or 2 courses here, the other courses are havoc. The photographer example was spot on. This video REALLY helped me change my perspective. Thanks a lot. I really feel like this video was tailor made for me. Thanks again ! Subscribed, ofc :)\n",
      "for me, what got my career in coding started was my experience as a student programmer for a company near my university that hired me on basically as an intern. They hired me because I worked for them on my Senior capstone project (fall semester) so I worked for them as an intern during my last semester, through that following summer, and then I landed my first full time job in the fall. I would have stayed with them had they been talking to me and expressed interest in actually treating me like an actual employee.\n",

      "i struggled through school, but now looking back, im actually very glad i took these courses. for one, it taught me the limits of my knowledge and how much there is to learn. taking these classes don't make you an expert in the field. instead, it teaches introduces you to the fundamentals in the broad field of computer science. armed with this fundamental knowledge, you can have a much clearer perspective of how the pieces come together and allows you to problem solve better. \n",

      "Pretty good summary! I disagree with the statement that it isn't a science, however. CS researchers routinely make falsifiable claims about the real world and then test those claims through experiments. In fact, that's how I'm spending my winter holiday :) Like, \"If I solve this problem with method X instead of method Y, I get a more reliable answer.\" Of course, if you only have empirical evidence (i.e. it's been tested in the real world) your case is weaker than if you have a mathematical proof. So in that way, it might be that some problems CS folks tackle are \"scientific\" empirical questions until they can be handled more rigorously with mathematics. But some big, popular branches of CS like Machine Learning and AI advance primarily through empirical, rather than mathematic, evidence. Whether mathematics itself is a science I will leave to the writers of dictionaries :)\n",
      "As a sidenote, we don't know if prime factorization is NP-complete… and we don't know if it's P either! We only know it's NP. I'd be surprised if someone discovered it to be in P—and also if someone found it to be NP-complete, because this would mean quantum computers would solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. If someone proofs that prime factorization is not P, and not NP-complete, we'd finally know once and for all that P != NP (via Ladner's theorem).\n",

I'm currently a graduate student in computer science and I also teach freshman computer science courses (I'm a teaching assistant so I teach labs, professors give lectures), and from what I've seen, at least 40% of the freshmen entering computer science will be weeded out by the end of the year. Or as Tren Black would say: business by christmas. Also very important: contrary to what a lot of people think, CS is NOT software engineering. You're not just going to be writing code all the time, you're going to have to study algorithms, data structures, formal methods, discrete math, computer architecture, etc. If you don't like math and you're not good at math, you better buckle up and start reviewing or you too will be \"business by Christmas\".\n",

I got lucky ending up in Silicon Valley but there is no doubt in my mind that the degree is extremely lucrative anywhere in the developed world. At my university, computer engineering was 85% computer science, 15% electrical/electronics engineering. It's functionally equivalent to computer science as far as the industry is concerned. I chose to take robotics electives in school but don't actually use those skills in my job. I'm just a standard software developer/engineer. Haha.\n",

I'd definitely recommend the degree route as it lays the complete foundation and gives you the flexibility to learn about some of the more advanced specializations like machine learning, artificial intelligence, programming languages, computer graphics, game development, distributed systems, and more in a controlled learning environment with ample timing before jumping straight into the subset of the industry you're interested in.\n",

      "1) There are also not versions of all the gates. AND, OR, and XOR become NAND, NOR, XNOR, respectively. They are represented by adding a small circle to the end of the gate. While they can be formed just by adding a not gate at the end of the inputs, they are common enough that they get their own specialized parts. You often here people verbally NAND and XNOR when talking about logic, so I think it is interesting to note even though this isn't computer engineering.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) While by convention in truth tables 1 is true and 0 is false, this is often not the case when we actually look at real components. Because of power usage, the opposite is often used. Generally, the more common output is set to 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) 0 doesn't actually mean nothing is flowing through. For example, we may set our 1 to 5 volts, and our 0 to 2.3 volts. This allows for us to have an \"off\" state at 0 volts. We wouldn't want our computer to be calculating stuff with 0s when it is off! There are also other uses for this state, but this may be covered in a future video.\n",

If you really don’t find a lot of interest in algorithms, data structures, and theory of cs, as viable as it is, this major may most probably not be for you.

      "Here’s a story for you beginners , I went into my first class of cse with no knowledge of coding, I got a C in intro to Java, okay yeah I did bad but then I wanted to get better so I did some practice over the winter to improve my logic, okay B in the next highest class the following semester, Software 1. Then over the summer I was able to learn so many other languages, Swift, Python, JavaScript. I had all this growth in a little under a year. All I’m saying is if you guys are worried about being a beginner who doesn’t know how to code, and don’t think it will get easier. Trust me, it gets easier, do simple personal projects to help yourself get the flow of implementing your own logic in things like (it else’s, while for loops etc) to help you gain a feel of how they work. I would struggle on projects during the semester on how to make a blackjack game in java, as a beginner this is a daunting task for me. So over winter break I made projects such as, modeling a Car in java, okay what functions does a car have, accelerate, decelerate, break, etc. from then I could think of variables, okay what could toggle a car being on or off? Oh a boolean! Oh maybe my car should run only when the gas level is greater than zero, okay that’s loop there, with gas level modeled as an int. See things like this slowly helped my logic grow, and now I can tackle any language or problem my class throws at me. Trust me  I’m still a beginner as well, but I ended up catching up to the kids around me when I was once behind, and in times when you feel like giving up, please don’t, I urge you to stick through it because it does get easier.\n",

I think what kept me going was practicing and building my own projects. I was fascinated by the cool games and projects I can create, and that made programming even more enjoyable to me. I would also recommend finding a coding partner or a coding club (as suggested in this video) because you can help each other out and build projects together.

      "I think she's talking about software engineering education, not computer science education. Math is an integral part of computer science, because math is the language of science. If you took math from computer science, by definition, you took science out of computer science, which is quite bizarre.\n",

      "I'm a first year CS student at a major German university and my current classes are introduction to programming, computer architecture, automata theory, calculus and linear algebra. I went into it not having a background in CS at all, I really only went into it because I have a thing for logic and structure and I don't regret my decision at all! At the beginning I was worried because I didn't know how to code at all and I had to put in some extra hours in the beginning compared to the kids who have been doing this since they were in infant but it's totally possible.\n",
      "A CS degree is basically a math major. With some programming, if you plan on taking cs make sure u actually enjoy it rather than doing it for the money.\n",
      "CS requires a person who is patient, persistent, creative in solutions... Basically not someone who sees a wall and says i am done. That's how you can know. Further as you grow into CS you will find out that you have been taught how to solve any problem, even if not from this field: think, research, learn, craft. Every experience that you go through will you improve at those steps. You will graduatelly stumble across moments where you will be overwhelmed, and it's ok, because you also learn that progress is through error after error, only for the new problem to come to you, and apply the same process; you already can handle being overwhelmed.\n",
      "To add to this - CS is also a major for those who like to practice outside the classroom, I am a current CS major at Lawrence Technological University and the majority of my programming practice came from implementing the techniques taught in class to personal projects outside of the curriculum, I believe this is an important element to the CS degree path in order to get really good.\n",

      "This video was incredibly well done!  This lady is really great at teaching material in a clear, easy-to-follow manner.\n",
      "I've always thought it interesting how differently sorting algorithms work to how we, as humans, seem to sort things; it seems like we're much more efficient than many of the algorithms (at least the ones I've seen, which is admittedly few). For example, when we look at all the items, we remember what we saw before and can change more than one thing at once (e.g. \"oh, I remember that was the smallest before I found the actual smallest, so that's the second smallest. Let me put both of them first and second right now, saving myself a re-look\"). I know computers are still faster in the end, but I suspect that's because we physically cannot write or move objects around as quickly as a computer can physically write data (and possibly our brain has a slower \"clock speed\"), rather than computational efficiency. Anyone know if that's true?\n",
      "\n",
      "Has anyone made a \"human sort\" algorithm, so to speak, that sorts the way we do, including our little \"tricks\"? (I'm guessing no). If not, are there any algorithms that at least take advantage of a trick or two, like the one I just described?\n",
      "Just a few things to note about the \"big-oh\" notation discussed in this episode:\n",
      "\n",
      "In industry, \"big-oh\" notation alone is what is seen when discussing algorithms. However, in academia, it is a bit more in depth. O(n) is instead used to represent an upperbound (in the WORST CASE, what is this problem or algorithm). Ω(n) (pronounced \"big-omega\") is used to represent the lowerbound (in the BEST CASE, what is this problem or algorithm). Θ(n), prounounced \"theta\" (without the \"big\") is used to represent the tightbound (used when the big-oh is equal to the big-omega, which is the exact running time). There is also small omega and small o, but those are rarely used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, we only care about the biggest polynomial when we use this notation. So if a problem takes 5n^4 + 3n^2 + 1 to do, we just say it is Θ(n^4). We drop the coefficient and smaller terms because we only care about what happens when n is really really big.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may notice that earlier I mentioned algorithm or problem when describing the notation. This is because the it is often used in academia to denote all of the algorithms that exist for a problem. For example, for matrix multiplication of an n x n matrix, we have Ω(n^2), since we know that we at least need to read in n^2 values. This problem currently has O(n^2.3728639) which is the running time of an algorithm created by Francois Le Gall in 2014.\n",
      "In school I had to write a bubble sort in 16bit intel ASM. It worked, was efficient and was well documented. It got me an A+. Even like 15 years later, I am so damn proud of that piece of code. :-D\n",

      "I had a tutor and a friend student that excelled in classes. The tutor is doing well but my friend is now deceased beaten to death as a street person on drugs. The tutor that helped me told me that the reason one goes to school is to learn to teach yourself. If University does not teach you to teach yourself, you have failed, because if you can't teach yourself you can not teach others what you have learned.

      "10:38 just an extra note about using SHA for passwords: while it can be used, its often not the best choice. SHA was designed to be fast to compute making it very useful for older hardware and things like signatures, but you typically want the exact opposite for passwords. For a password hashing algorithm, you want it as slow as possible until it starts annoying users. That way, an attacker will be able to calculate fewer hashes per second while brute forcing. As of right now, the usual choices for password hashing are bcrypt or argon2id, both of which were designed to be slow.\n",

      "Yes, this is what was able to get me to wrap my head around coding. For anyone that's getting deeper into learning web dev stuff, I highly recommend Scrimba. It has a great problem-solving based approach to learning where you get small challenges constantly so you can come up with the solution by tying what you've learned together instead of just showing you the solution first. There's also some really cool tech on their platform where you get a live integrated cloud-based coding environment with all of the source files for each challenge automatically updated as you go through the course so it's very seamless and the video tutorial part of it is not a video but instead is a scripted live editing of the code in the text editor. You can pause it at any time and directly edit the code that's being written during the tutorial.\n",

I've been doing frontend for 4 months now and sometimes I struggle with some programing concepts in JavaScript so...I'm enrolling now.\n",
      "I've been taking the course and I'm still on lecture 1, good to hear positive reviews, reinforcing my experience so far! I'll come back and update this when I finish.\n",
      "I started it a few years ago and went to week 2, but started working solo and never came back to it. \n",

      "I did my undergrad in Computer Science and I'm finishing up my MS in Computer Engineering. It always drives me nuts when people ask what I do and then assume either is just \"programming\" or \"software engineering\". I try to explain it like this: Computer Science is centered around mathematics(computational science) and problem solving; developing algorithms and optimization. Programming is just a means of applying mathematics and problem solving techniques to problems. Computer Engineering is focused on the development and design of computer systems. I always get a reaction to my code from the guys that took Computer/Electrical Engineering as undergrads. Because they, generally speaking, are simply trying to make X thing work, and I am trying to make X thing run as efficient as possible. You can take several different paths to become a coder, but there's very different mindsets developed across the different disciplines. Anyone looking at going to school for Computer Science should understand this. You are learning to be a problem solver first, coding is secondary. Anyone can learn to code. But, being a master problem solver is what will set you apart in life and your career. If you go down this path, you are going to be doing far more math than coding, and at the end your undergrad you will realize you barely learned how to code. You will have to spend countless hours after graduation learning coding concepts, libraries, and frameworks. But, those problem solving skills are what will allow you to put all of that to use. I hope this helps someone understand what they are getting into.\n",
      "Wow, what a guest! I was listening to this guy's lectures on Python last year. He has a knack for explaining complex things in a very simple way.\n",
      "David was my motivation not to give up ever. Not that long ago I was working on a farm and listening his ccna courses. Today I'm managing 6 production servers and complete industrial network infrastructure, and got involved in the software development as c# dev. Only by folowing one rule, that tomorows myself shall be proud of today's myself. Thank you David.\n",
      "Dr. Chuck's Python course is *literally* how I got started with my career in tech and software engineering/DevOps engineering.

One of them was computer science and telecommunications. And tbh despite the fact that I had zero interest in programming before, I freaking love this major so much. Sure it's hard and frustrating af but every day you learn something new and it feels so good when you run your code and it actually works.\n",
      "Andrew Tanenbaum books on CS helped me a lot during uni years and sometimes during discussions at work but they give theoretical knowledge not practical applications\n",
      "My biggest tip: if you're a computer science student and have the chance (it was not required at my college) to take software engineering, make sure you take all the software engineering classes you can because that's what you'll be doing.  Most of CS is a lot of abstract data structures and ideas that you may never even ever use, but knowing the pipeline of actually creating software and those different methodologies (Agile which is just old school RAD with more crap to have to deal with, Waterfall, Spiral, etc. etc.) will give you a better idea of what you'll be doing on the day to day.  You'll tailor your data structure and algorithm knowledge to what you're tasked with at work, but the software engineering portion you'll use anywhere you go.\n",

      "The question which fascinated me the most was \" how one could make the lives of programmer a lot easier?\"\n",
      "The reason why i tell you this is because I am very exited about your opinion on this topic!Especially the following 2 questions would interest me the most:\n",
      "1. As programmer, what are/ were the 2 biggest issues you’re dealing with?\n",

I have been having a similar dilemma, I originally signed up for software development, but my counselor said I should do CS since I said I want the ability to be hands on, on top of developing.  Not sure if I am thinking too big....... but thanks great video!\n",
      "To hear that you didn't have any preparation before college makes me feel better for being in the same position.

      "I go to ODU - so do you actually feel like you learned a lot in 350? I haven't taken it yet, but a lot of people I've talked to say it's massively outdated and just a ton of busy work. I understand that can help you practice discipline, but was it useful any other way in getting ready for your career?\n",
      "So my University currently has both Software Engineering and Computer Science. Both majors are pretty much the same thing and the only difference is about 3 or 4 classes. For example, for the Data Structures and Algorithms course, there is CIS 350 (theory based) and CIS 3501 (SE side of the class) also the core requirements has SE majors take SE 2 after SE 1 while CS majors only take SE 1. So its really the same degree, same requirements, only difference is a couple of classes (that are very similar).\n",

I based my solution on the way Nature would create an inner expanding bubble until touching all the nodes with minimal tensional energy. I used Basic in an 80286 PC, with about 100 random nodes.

I managed to make it work for minimum hop count and shortest path between two points.  Unfortunately it doesnt solve the TSP because it does not go back to it starting point.. only that it can hit every point.  We had another idea of using something similar to what we called gravitic weighting to image creating the shortest path by picking any point and then \"lifting it\" and seeing the other points fall based upon distance.. we ran into problems with pruning of ineffecient routes.. if we could identify routes that were not going to be used we think it would have worked.. unfortunately our advisor didnt seem to care to help us at all... to him TSP was just an impossible problem and we were waisting our time.\n",

      "\n",
      "I was a freshman data science major last year and I had never written a single line of code. I got a C in my intro to Java course and I was very disappointed as it was something I really want to pursue. I was worried about my performance in the next course Software 1, and if my grade would be lower. I worked on my own projects to better understand the logic and I ended up finishing with an A in the next course, and this was all over the course of one winter break! Now I’m making apps with swiftUI and solving data science machine learning problems in python! And this was all over the course of a year! Don’t be afraid if you struggle early on, it’s a part of the journey.\n",
      "My advice as someone who just graduated with a CS degree and was also a peer tutor is to take the time to do your work and understand the code that you're writing. Too many times I see people slap shit together and then wonder why it doesn't work\n",
      "I'm in 4th year of my CS studies right now. Unfortunatelly, I needed to realize all of the stuff you mentioned on my own. I feel like in some cases it can be a little bit late. I just hope somebody would talk to me about this at the beggining. I would say to all new CS students: 'This will be harder than you think. But the balance is the most important thing'.\n",
      "I’m starting college/uni this year in the Computer Science course!! This was so timely🥺🥰🤩\n",
      "Another thing I've found helpful as a CS major is to make sure to capitalize on those required gen-ed classes (subjects like History, English, Philosophy, etc.). Having a spare 100-level \"Intro to X\" class in your workload during a tough quarter doing hours upon hours of Java/Python can really defray the pressure. Many of these are also just as good when taken online as well!\n",
      "Great tips! I would also like to say that understanding logic is very important. My professor really stressed this in my first programming class. He said that he has interviewed graduates who got through their entire college career through trial and error. I think that he is right. Unless you can explain every single piece of your code, line by line, you don't really understand the logic behind it. \n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, he makes us go to the lab and the TA asks us to explain our code line by line if we want the full marks on the assignment.\n",
      "never say,\" I'll do it later\" when it comes to assignments and projects.\n",
      "I'll write some more tips later\n",
      "Another tip is to take your time. Don't force yourself into like 5-6 classes. 4 classes (3 majors, one elective) would be your best friend.\n",
      "My advice: Get into your school's CS discords and class specific discords (if they have them, or make one if there isn't) . Graduate and undergraduate students work together to give lots of resources for all students and it help a lot. Especially with what proffesors are good and bad, they help with assignments and even answer general questions.\n",

      "35 mins in, i am absolutely engrossed & loving the concise breakdown. Much love!\n",
      "Steven, this video was awesome! You clearly put a lot of preparation into your lessons, and the slide visuals are top notch compared to most other CS educational videos. You definitely earned a subscriber\n",
      "I failed my precalc class my first semester of college. I did an easier math class the second semester and passed it. I'm ready to try the precalc again. Even though I failed the class, I learned that math is one of the most beautiful languages in the world. Math is great. I'm not good at it by any stretch. I will still conquer this though.\n",
      "The reason sooo many fear and fail at math is not because it is hard. It is because they treat it like the other basic education subjects. \n",
      "Think differently and know that you cannot succeed at math by studying night before, remembering a few equations like dates in history class, nor by just scrapping by. \n",
      "Office hours are the key to succeess, yes. But even more important than that, you MUST COMPLETE ALL HOMEWORK WHEN DUE, AND DONT EVER GIVE UP ON A SINGLE PROBLEM. THEN, YOU MUST PRACTICE, PRACTICE! \n",
      "Don’t study. Only practice. That way you don’t just know, you have complete UNDERSTANDING ABOUT CONCEPTS. Much like pointing out a particular color in the room, you should practice until you can look at any series of alpha numeric characters and be able to identify what it is asking and instantly knowing (like identifying red + letters S T O P means \"stop!\") how to approach the problem and what equation, formula etc to use. Tools in a toolbox, Baby.\n",
      "Calculus, Discrete Math, Linear Algebra IS A MUST!!!\n",
      "Lmao just changed my major to CS and was nervous for the math portion. Then I realized I’m not actually that bad at math and I was making it seem worse than it was. Don’t know if that will change when the semester starts but I’m excited! Gotta say thank you Forrest you’re the reason I felt confident in changing my major to Computer Science!\n",
      "Throughout my life I always viewed math as something negative and sucked at it. However, during freshman year of college I decided that computer science it is and started out taking basic math classes (pre-algebra). Currently I am taking Precalculus and will go up to Calc 2. What made me get to where I am is the mindset.\n",
      "its important to note that it also depends on your college. some CS departments like the engineering department requires lot of math while others dont like arts and sciences\n",
      "Thanks for the video! Getting into my first math CS courses and it's been challenging, but you're absolutely right. Hard work is what helps you get better at math and understand concepts not memorize formulas.\n",
      "This is a reall helpful video, thanks considering I want to go into CS. Videos about your process to solving complex problems would be great since I'm doing pure math in school. 🙏\n",
      "Hey Forrest! I'm starting as a freshman in a few weeks and I'm wondering what your thoughts are on pursuing a computer science degree online as apposed to a physical college. Any insight would be greatly appreciated! :)\n",
      "I stumbled upon your page a few days ago and I must say it's been the best learning experience in terms narrowing down specific areas to focus on. Excellent content!\n",
      "Kirby this year really is just the gift that keeps on giving\n",
      "This is really cool! My only gripe is that it’s only 2 player local and not 4, when wireless and online are 4 player(although it’s likely frame rate issues), hopefully they add 4 player local in the future, but other than that the game looks like great fun!\n",
      "Finally, a game that truly gets me on a spiritual level.\n",
      "I love that Elfilin already has stuff in this game, Forgotten Land was just before this, so I was really surprised to see the stage, as well as the cosmetics.\n",
      "I love the part when Kirby is quickly eating the 50 Strawberry Cake. I imagine all this fun stuff from “Kirby’s Epic Yarn” when he couldn’t contain himself from a giant cake. I don’t care either, gotta love that cake!\n",
      "I love how you can add “Dream” in front of any regular object and make it a powerful Kirby artifact.\n",
      "I've seen art of food-based abilities before, but not traditional abilities in the style of foods. It works unexpectedly well!\n",
      "Yo! This looks soooooo fun! The variety of modes & cosmetics, competitive & co-op options, etc, & for 15$?!?!?!? YAYUS!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I also love the attention to detail & references like Master & Crazy hand or the hands in some of the menus at 0:40, 64 Needle Kirby in 1:55, & a Smash Bros reference at 2:54!\n",
      "This looks pretty fun, only big let down is it seems to only go up to two players in local splitscreen.\n",
      "The pricing is really good here! Great job Nintendo!\n",
      "Sonic can totally pull off more serious stories like in Adventure 2. I'm glad they're taking that approach with Frontiers. I'm optimistic about this one!🤩\n",
      "It seems like they're actually going for a serious story this time! I hope they manage to pull it off. The cutscenes look so gorgeous and the areas do to. I was pretty sold on playing this game but now I'm really excited! \n",
      "(Also this comment is gonna be really dated depending on what the game is like when it comes out. I guess it'll be like my own little time capsule to revisit years later)\n",
      "Whether or not this Sonic plays out to what we want it to be, we should give thanks to the people that spend many hours developing this game! Looks great 👍\n",
      "I'm loving the cyberspace stages and story so far. Nice to see another island in this trailer too! Can't wait to get this at Christmas. Maybe it'll be one of the few games I've 100%'d\n",
      "I REALLY REALLY REALLY hope they don't screw this one up. Like, I'd like to actually hear good things about a mainline 3D sonic game made by sonic team that's actually good.\n",
      "Beautiful, finally a new sonic game that does justice for the original series, the first showcase was strange, but this one is definitely better compared to the old one\n",
      "I can't understand why some areas look genuinely breathtaking, then others are just floating disjoined rails and walls. I don't understand how there's such a massive difference!\n",
      "I always love when sonic is more serious instead of cracking jokes hopefully he takes things seriously in this game.\n",
      "So… this actually looks good. As long as Egghead doesn’t come back as another villain pulling the strings, looks promising.\n",
      "Finally, a trailer that makes Sonic Frontiers look exciting!\n",
      "Tickets for IndieLand 2022 are on sale now! http://indieland2022.eventbrite.com/\n",
      "The 3DS is probably my favorite system of all time. With access to all DS games and the impressive digital library, almost no other system library can compare. The library isn’t only large, it’s diverse. There are bangers for every genre of game. All of this is a portable package.\n",
      "I recently started playing Kid Icarus Uprising and, apart from needing to take a few breaks to rest my hands, I am shocked with how much fun I'm having with it and I'm bummed that there hasn't been a sequel made since then.\n",
      "Love the 3DS!\n",
      "\n",
      "Planet Robobot's true arena is one of the most satisfying challenges to overcome across all games. Would be #1 on my personal list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great memories of playing Smash Run w friends while getting lunch or wutever else.\n",
      "Fire Emblem became one of Nintendo’s larger series thanks to the 3DS. I don’t really play Fates or SoV anymore but I still find myself revisiting Awakening, love that game. If you can step outside of your completionist mindset you’d probably love it\n",
      "I was surprised Kid Icarus: Uprising isn't on here. I think it's the best 3DS game. It's a true masterpiece. Yet again, Sakurai developed this game too, and a lot of his games are gold. He's a very hard worker and has high expectations for his games.\n",
      "3DS just felt so special. I didn't expect it but found myself really into Pokémon Sun and Moon. I think Pokémon Refresh was a huge addition to making me attached to my team, and I found myself tearing up in a lst battle when my Mismagus held on to the end for me. I know it ruins the game for some people (the Pokémon holding on has a higher rate of stopping KO than the focus band, apparently but don't quote me on that) but for me it was JUST want i wanted as a jaded almost-30 year old who really just wanted to enjoy the game.\n",
      "Smash on 3DS was a marvel in it's own right. The fact the 3DS could handle it AND at 60FPS on the OG 3DS was absolutely mind blowing to me for the time\n",
      "My favorite series is the Dillon’s Rolling Western series. I remember going on the eshop to find The Last Ranger being advertised. However, I wouldn’t get it until I grew up a bit more. Dillon’s character stood out when I am already attracted to stylized games. \n",
      "All three of the games are tower defense where you are trying to clear waves as fast as possible. Currently all of the games are exclusive to the eshop. Unless you live in a PAL region, those games will be lost to time.\n",
      "Kid Icarus Uprising is my favourite game of all time. The combat is fun, the weapons are cool, the characters are funny and layered, and the story and world building is fantastic.  It's been half the time there was between the last two games in the series, but I will gladly wait another 10 years to get more Kid Icarus goodness\n",
      "I know this will get overlooked, but I really wanna give props to the announcer, she did a fantastic job and put so much energy into the announcement, it honestly made me pretty hyped\n",
      "For those who didn’t notice, the store manager for the locker items is Harmony, a character that has actually been somewhat present before in the series. She’s part of the musical band known as Chirpy Chips that plays all sorts of battle music in Splatoon 2. If you look it up, she’s right there on the album cover!\n",
      "I love how the splatoon colour themes are based on complimentary colours (opposite colours), for example…\n",
      "\n",
      "Splatoon 1 - orange and blue\n",
      "Splatoon 2 - pink a green\n",
      "Splatoon 3 - yellow and purple\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the colours are slight variations such as pink, it’s meant to be red but pinks a good substitute\n",
      "For those who have questions about this Direct\n",
      "\n",
      "1: you can actually skip the news this time\n",
      "\n",
      "2: Salmon run can be played at any time\n",
      "\n",
      "3: in Rainmaker there are multiple checkpoints now\n",
      "I’ll always love splatoon. They never take away things that people have always liked and instead they either make it better or add on things we’ve wanted. I’m just really obsessed because I’ve always loved this game since I was little :)\n",
      "whoever this announcer was definitely needs a raise. everything was so easily digestible, and i’m glad new players can find their way even easier! she sounded so energetic, intrigued, and passionate overall. this 30 minute direct was beautifully executed!\n",
      "I'm going to miss the idols from Splatoon 2, they slayed, perfect character design, and wonderful personalities! I didn't expect we would get three idols, Big man, Shiver and Frye! They seem to have a lot of potential, I'm looking forward to doing story mode too! The gameplay must be amazing!\n",
      "I was genuinely afraid, I thought the game would be identical to the second, or even worse!  But this Direct definitely made me change my mind!  There are crazy news, the setting is much more oriental than that of previous games, and I love it.  New weapons, story mode that feels spatial, practically a free choice of character customization of much more!  I have no negative comments, the only flaw could be a short duration of the Story mode, which for lone players like me could be a problem, but I sincerely hope I'm wrong! 🐙\n",
      "The expressions of the characters are perfect and everything looks so lively like the inklings have actually remade civilisation but no humans. Nintendo doesn't just cease to be awful. They don't know how to!\n",
      "The announcer here and on the direct is so good. She sounds so energetic and passionate and it fits the game really well and gets me excited to play even more.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am so unbelievably hyped up for this game omg\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been a fan of Splatoon one but I didn’t get a hold of the game until Splatoon 2 cause I was poor lol\n",
      "I legit can’t wait to play this every day.\n",
      "I’m definitely interested to see harvestella shown off. The concept sounds really cool, but the trailer left me with very little idea as to how it would actually work, so I’m interested to see more\n",
      "It'd be nice that even when digital takes over for games that they offer a buy from the manufacturer option where you could order a physical copy online and get it shipped from wherever they made the game. Because I fully expect digital merchandise to be abused/capitalized in some way out of favor for the consumer.\n",
      "For these kinds of shows, I think I'd prefer a rapid-fire series of announcements in 30-60 minutes, followed by a lengthier presentation going in-depth into specific games. That way, those that are interested in a specific title can check out the deep-dive of that game in specific after the main presentation.\n",
      "Wanted to wish everyone a Happy Wednesday today & love watching your video game news everyday Jon keep up the great Work! 👍\n",
      "I am actually kind of looking forward to harvestella... its a very pretty game.\n",
      "The fact that the version of RE7 that came out was considered \"marketing's worst nightmare\" shows you that listening to marketing people is a foolish idea when it comes to creative endeavours.\n",
      "After seeing that new Splatoon 3 spawning cannon thing for the tenth time, I just realized it’s how the developers wanted to tackle spawn camping which was a nightmare in the prior games.\n",
      "Gamescon had quite a few games that peaked my interests but that sony edge controller was the most intriguing. Looks like we can hot swap joysticks which could be a fix to combat drift.\n",
      "Whenever I see a company announce a release date I never take it seriously anymore and almost expect there to be a delay\n",
      "As term of gamescom I was excited for Gotham Knights villain trailer and the release moving up to October 21st I'm still getting day 1. I'm excited for Castillo protocol I'm excited for sonic frontiers finally getting a release date in November. And I loved the new trailer of Hogwarts legacy\n",

      "There's a lot of promise coming up but. Nintendo please. It was a huge 3DS hit. Please remaster or remake Tomodachi Life!\n",
      "Nintendo just put out a better Sonic trailer than Sega did. This should have been the first trailer for the game. It makes so much more sense than the weird rollout Sega did\n",
      "This might be in the running for the best direct ever. So little downtime, each announcement was ranging from cool and not my thing, to wow\n",
      "THANK YOU FOR FINALLY PUTTING PERSONA 5 ON THE SWITCH, I HAVE BEEN WAITING\n",
      "I do quite like how the splatana feels like a samurai, stealth based ninja weapon. Diversifies the gameplay quite a bit.\n",
      "Well-worded and gracefully honest! It does like quite the quality title- I'm excited as a hardcore Splatoon fan. I have 670 hours on 2, so small changes still do mean a lot to me after playing the second game for the past 5 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, it doesn't hurt to want just a little bit more for a sequel. I'm hoping that future additions to the game will help it to become even better.\n",
      "The power eggs always had a use. You could buy weapons and upgrade them using the power eggs. Within the single player\n",
      "The graphics actually look a lot smoother, more intricate and more polished, as well as the frame rate and overall flow of movement, which is super nice. I wasn't expecting a graphical improvement after the first footage we saw, but now I'm happy.\n",
      "I wasn't really expecting any new formula for the Single Player & Im completely fine with the stuff you mentioned. Maybe they'll explore new things in the paid DLC\n",
      "\n",
      "From the trailers I've seen & your gameplay, you get shot onto the stage for Turf Wars & Anarchy Battles thus getting rid of team specific spawn areas. Perhaps that's what made the maps feel bigger? Can't wait to see how they update the Splatoon/Splatoon 2 stages\n",
      "I guess in terms of a single player mode for Splatoon 3 I was hoping for a Bowser's Fury type of world where it feels more grand, some exploration and seemless transitions into the \"levels\".\n",
      "I feel like the biggest sell for Splatoon 3 is the timing. With the switch being as old as it is now, most people have a switch in their home. So for kids this is a big buy, especially if you haven't played it yet, but all your friends are playing it. I haven't played in a few years and I'm really excited. Just to chill, enjoy all it has to offer along with the community surrounding it. It's a lot easier to sell this game to a Japanese audience as well because of all the marketing and promotional events after the game comes out. As well as the IRL concerts with their in game idols.\n",
      "My biggest hope for splatoon three is to get it and have fun playing through the waves of content as they tend to be fun and hype as they come out, that being said for outsiders of the community I’m disappointed and really wish that it gives enough to entice new fans and not just old ones\n",
      "I honestly hope it's great considering that Splatoon is my  personal 2nd favorite Nintendo franchise behind Mario\n",
      "I am LIVING for the revolutionary joke. Gonna be giggling about that for a while. Great breakdown and honest feedback!\n",
      "This looks much better than the first wave, waluigis pinball and mushroom gorge make the whole expansion worth it.\n",
      "I remember trying to pass the first pinball in Waluigi Pinball as a young kid. The feeling of accomplishment you got from beating it too the ramp where it falls was great. Definitely one of my favorite tracks. The pinball machine segment, the most chaotic place in any track that gets more chaotic every lap which may be why it’s so popular.\n",
      "I’m literally hyped for this wave, they have Waluigi’s Pinball! I do find it interesting that they are also creating completely new tracks as well ( like the sundae one), as most people suspected complete remakes of the originals. All in all, I’m excited\n",
      "I can't watch this without a huge smile on my face! Wave 2 looks incredible!\n",
      "\n",

      "(Edit: Apparently auto correct likes strives better than thrives)\n",

      "What I love about the Xenoblade series is their integration of their battle mechanics and story line. It hits different.\n",
      "This game looked really good. I’m a non Xenoblade fan and checked out this direct and I gotta say it genuinely got me interested in the series. I’ll definitely check this out if I can buy this game\n",

      "\n",
      "Edit: was expecting a typical nopon voice didn't expect Riku to sound like such a Chad 🤣\n",
      "I feel like this is Nintendo's version of the final fantasy series. I hope the Xenoblade Chronicles continues to expand. This will surely keep me busy for a long time\n",
      "I'll never get tired of watching this masterpiece direct !! The game has so much content, plus the interlink mechanic is just INSANE! They definitely incorporated a truly amazing mechanic after the Driver/Blade one in XC2, Monolith truly never dissapoints!!!\n",
      "This really feels like a perfect blend between all three previous xenoblade games, in terms of gameplay, art-style, and world features. I'm starting to really feel it!\n",
      "This looks like the most complex battle system I have ever seen. Layer after layer of options. I am giddy after each function shown. i cant wait to play this. I will have to buy it and play.\n",

      "I hope one day people understand, Gabe Newell once said \" The easiest way to stop piracy is not by putting antipiracy technology to work. It's by giving those people a service that's better than what they're receiving from the pirates.\" truer words are yet to be spoken amidst this industry.\n",
      "Questions:\n",
      "Does the DRM appy to anything played on the Switch or just some upcoming titles? Do I need an internet connection to play on the Switch? Im always connected, so I had no idea this might be the case. Will DRM make the switch unusable in another console generation or two?\n",
      "This is part of why I stick with the older consoles. All these servers, network logins, and DRM stuff just ruins gaming for me. I just like popping the game in and playing.\n",
      "It will probably not be an \"online check\" DRM. I saw a flash of a website in the video on emulation piracy DRM. Denuvo probably thinks that they have a way for a game to be able to run a check to see if it's running in an emulated environment. Based on their history using kernel-mode DRM / anti-cheat BS on the PC I would avoid any switch game running anything from denuvo.\n",
      "The thing with drm like denuvo is that it literally pushed piracy more. I've had a couple of friends with RE: 8 on PC that literally got the pirated version downloaded just cause it performs 100x better. And for me personally. I bought the ultimate version of dying light 2. I really enjoyed it but i had to lower settings cause I thought my PC couldn't handle it or something but then I tried out the cracked version and then all of a sudden the game runs like butter. I hate denuvo and if used frequently on switch. It will ruin games and even trust from the fanbases.\n",
      "It's also worth noting that the primary assumption behind DRM is that people that would pirate a game if there's no DRM would legally buy the game if there's DRM.  That's a really absurd assumption.  Most people that are actually doing the pirating would otherwise not buy the game at all, so their piracy has a net zero impact on the developer.\n",
      "\n",
      "And DRM gets cracked in only a few months, so the pirates need only wait anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "DRM does only one thing, and that's punish the people that legally buy the game.\n",
      "The eff is what I said immediately. Denuvo does not stop piracy! It kills game performance.\n",
      "That's exactly what switch games need. Something to hinder the performance and bog stuff down. Brilliant.\n",
      "Man, every year that passes I'm feeling more and more vindicated in emulation and archiving.\n",

      "The fact that you revisit some patched games is one of the things I love most about your channel.  While I’ll say that many games should not release in the poor state that they do, such is the state of the gaming world in 2022.  You guys do all of a wonderful service by updating your reviews when possible.  Thank you!\n",
      "It’s easy to be harsh on the Switch and the way some ports perform but it’s amazing to have full games like this on the move. When developers get it right it really sings\n",
      "This is why I love this channel they don’t just abandon games at a review\n",
      "I suppose it's because I grew up when all video games had pop in so it doesn't really create a negative connotation for me with a game.  I know that if a game isn't wholly designed for the Switch that issues can occur with frame rates, pacing and the like but it is always nice to see when developers continue to work on and iron out the problems with their games. I think the patch was needed and accomplished what it was supposed to.\n",
      "A note for your souldiers revisit, while the patch fixed a lot of the worst issues, the fire temple, a late game area, is still prone to a lot of  crashing when saving at dragon swords, it was 50/50 every time I saved in that dungeon whether it would crash or not, didn't get any crashes anywhere else so I'm not sure why that area specifically is so problematic (it was also an area where one room in particular had a game breaking performance bug before the big patch)\n",
      "I preordered this and I didn’t really notice much of the original issues but I think that’s because I was just enjoying the gameplay and I was mainly playing handheld on an OLED but it’s always good to see developers going back and fixing things to improve the game\n",
      "Glad the performance has gotten better on split screen. I stomached it the first time through, but might return to mess around! Knew this game had potential on the switch\n",
      "There’s so many things that annoyed me about this game and I ended up quitting well before completion. I really like games with tight, responsive controls, where you can learn techniques to have complete mastery over your character’s move set. This game was like the opposite to that 😕\n",
      "I nearly got 100% completion with this game. Had to stop after more than a couple of side quests had a weird performance issue where it would stutter beyond belief. It took a lot of patience, but if you could finish the quest the stuttering stopped. It was frustrating. Usually they were quests where you had to find things that were all around a planet, so you had to traverse large areas. Trying to do so when every input took several seconds to respond was too much for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now I'm stuck on some backlog games, so I don't know if I'll ever have 100% completion. But maybe one day....\n",
      "i'm so glad that the direction they're going with when it comes to \"chaos\" is pure expression and a sense of warmth, rather than falling into the trap of being edgy\n",
      "It almost sounds like a blend of Indian, Japanese, and Brazilian culture, which really brings out the idea of diverse unity and expressionism that chaos is all about. I love it!\n",
      "I absolutely love how Chaos is used. Instead of being like an apocalypse or something, the chaos is presented as a huge jumble of culture. Love it.\n",
      "Whoever mixed this song is a genius. They managed to fit so many cultures in such a small amount of time, and managed to perfectly make fake squid language sound great, all whilst making a genuinely slapping song\n",
      "don’t get me wrong, the concert vibe from the other games was cool, but this fees like a whole festival and its really refreshing!\n",
      "shiver’s part sounds like traditional japanese songs, big man’s part sounds like a bit of brazilian funk maybe, frye’s part sounds like it’s traditional from middle eastern, and the chorus sounds like samba. i’m in love with this song\n",
      "I love the music, but another thing I noticed is how different every idol’s dance was. They had their own unique way of dancing according to their culture and it makes me so happy to see a mashup of multiple cultures in one performance.\n",
      "The only bad thing about this song is that it ends.\n",
      "Not sure if anyone else had noticed this, but when I rewatched this again, I saw that the platforms that Shiver, Frye, and Big Man were standing on actually connect together. The bottom part makes up a fish. Shiver’s platform is the head, Big Man’s the middle part, and Frye is the tail. Very subtle detail, I love it!\n",
      "I love all the other idol songs, but I gotta say: this song is the one that feels the most like a CELEBRATION. It has a cultural festival quality to it\n",

      "Plus I'm not sure how to feel about Aya Neo. They release a new console every 6 months, which makes me question their dedication to support in the long run. And they were WAY too expensive, and probably only brought the price down on this new one because of the Steam Deck.\n",

      "Wood! Thanks for reviewing this and introducing me to a new controller (I know you were mainly focusing on the mini streamdeck, but still)! I had never heard of it and I was looking for something like that because believe it or not, my pro controller/joycons all HAVE STICK DRIFT, so finding a controller that addresses that problem is exactly what I needed especially when it's got gyroscope capabilities too! (I play splatoon, so I need gyro and sticks with no drift of course.)\n",
      "Honestly, that tricolour, three team mode was what sold the game to me. It's just a shame that it's limited to Splatfests only. I felt like as a mode, that was the truly unique and franchise-pushing idea of a mode that warranted a whole sequel. Oh well, I guess Nintendo's servers wouldn't be able to handle it...\n",
      "\n",
      "At the moment, this is just what Splatoon 2 should have been back in 2017, to me. Splatoon really needs to evolve beyond the first game in quite tremendous or advanced ways in order to actually feel like a true sequel (the tricolour mode was close to that principle, but alas, it's only limited to Splatfests) - otherwise \"Stay Fresh!\" is just a quote of sheer irony because Splatoon has, thus far to me, not proven to stay fresh.\n",

      "This game is looking fresher than grocery store produce. I love the new  aesthetic and weapons. Plus the new features look really fun. I also love how you can customize your character with emotes and lockers, it fits perfectly with splatoon\n",
      "Only in Splatoon games, they keep making the foreheads bigger.\n",
      "3 Years Later : Still watching without having one\n",
      "I just watch unboxing vids to get that mental high of experiencing something new without actually splurging for it.\n",
      "I remember being so giddy and excited for this thing to come out. Watching videos, unboxings, gameplay, etc. Seeing this video again brings back some really great memories.\n",
      "This is amazing\n",

      "The red and blue design looks great.\n",
      "My brothers have one of each of these and I use them sometimes, the only problem we've run into with them is the joycons bugging out with the display. He has had to send them in twice for that and they still get that problem, but other than that it's a great system for us.\n",
      "The back is not for speakers, it's the intake vents for cooling the system. And the fan does actually run in handheld for games like Zelda.\n",

      "Je crains néanmoins la sortie sur switch, peur que cette version sois moins jolie. Je vais me tourner vers la version PC je crois. \n",
      "Bonne journée :)\n",
      "Salut Emb !!\n",
      "Je voulais savoir, si la version deluxe sera aussi au format physique pour l’accès anticipé de 72h, car j’ai fais des recherches sur internet et j’ai vue que l’édition collector a le droit à un accès anticipé.\n",
      "Je pence que les gens, qui  commande le collector recevront un mail avec un code pour l’accès de 72h du coup je me posé la question si ils allaient faire pareil avec la version deluxe au format physique enfin si elle existe…\n",
      "Merci Edouard pour ces précisions très précises :) Du coup je pourrais le préco demain sur ma Xbox Série S ? Merci de ta réponse (Nayko)\n",
      "J'ai hâte de jouer à ce jeux. J'espère qu'il va bien être optimisé sur Switch.\n",
      "Je pose ma question avant de finir la vidéo mais je voulais quand même ton avis sur le prix de la collector \n",
      "Je suis un énorme fan de la licence et je sens que je vais prendre la collector, mais quand même, elle est pas hyper chère ?\n",

      "This F is for respect not only to a great man but to the man who made a ton of Nintendo games possible R.I.P\n",
      "R.I.P Mr. Satoru Iwata for such a amazing console\n",
      "You did a great job , just got mine oled version and it was amazing . F for Mr.Sotaru Iwata Rest Well Legend ❤️\n",
      "Just got my OLED Model over two weeks and i personally like mines a ton been taking good care of it best gaming console I've own to date. PS: F for Mr Satoru Iwata!\n",
      "OK I think there were only 3 secrets the golf and weird home screen sounds I didn't know about, and the internet thing is pretty niche. But the rest of these should be known by anybody who has recently played their Nintendo switch for at least 5 hours.\n",
      "RIP Iwata, I was so sad when he died, he was the face of nintendo. What a loss, but his ideas gave the greatest success to the company and helped them move forward.\n",

      "Rip Iwata, a true legend ❤️\n",
      "Still happy with my original at the minute. I can't compensate paying for the upgrade personally. But fully understand why you would go for it as a first time switch buyer\n",
      "It's a bit expensive and I didn't want to buy it as I have the original but my husband bought it for me as an early Christmas present and I was able to transfer and re download my stuff. Overall I'm really happy with the Oled version. It feels more sturdy and the graphics are much better. I was able to sell my original switch so we got quite a bit of our money back so I say it's definitely worth it 🤗\n",
      "It looks neat! The screen looks slightly bigger and it looks like a quick cash grab if u have the original Switch and the Switch Lite. I love playing the Switch on table top mode with the Switch Pro controller! It feels more comfortable and it gives u that lil home console feel!\n",
      "THANK YOU. You just gave a good review unlike the stereotypical reviews that only bring up the \"its just a larger screen and that's it\" reviews that are bandwaggoning trash. So, thanks very much for this, you brought up a few things I didn't yet know about it! ☺\n",
      "Picked up on OLED and very happy with the bigger screen size. Paired with my Hori Split Pro joycons, its feels great...the stock joycons feel small and uncomfy. The screen for my old Switch looks like an old cheap tablet now with that huge bezel. If you have no fingernails, the cart door is way harder to open than the old Switch door.\n",
      "Is it just me or was the original switch more creaky when holding it than the oled? The oled seems incredibly solid. Not sure if it just loosens overtime\n",
      "I have the V2 but I do think the OLED is nice. I like how it has ethernet support,and I hear it has a padded dock now which they should of done from the beginning but oh well. I play only on my TV so I won’t be upgrading until a whole new system drops but I give the OLED a 9/10,def worth it for new switch buyers imo.\n",
      "The card slot is way harder to open on the oled, sucks for people like me with short fingernails. Never had this issue with the original so it's baffling as to why they changed it.\n",
      "Love my OLED. Such a premium experience compared to the original.\n",
      "If Nintendo makes another Switch, I really hope they make the Joy-cons bigger and more ergonomic.\n",
      "I think the free-choice gym makes sense because, in the pokemon world, there are trainers who start their journey from towns or cities more advanced than the first village of the main character. Imagine if every npc started from Pallet Town, that wouldn't make much sense right?\n",
      "These presents are really what all people need and love!!! Thank you so much!!!\n",
      "My man TOBY FOX did the unimaginable yet again I can't believe he made the music for the raid battle LET'S GOOO! 17:20\n",
      "Some cool improvements here, though I still think the gem forms are a little silly. Would love to just get mega evolution back, those were awesome\n",
      "This game seems to have a lot going for it, three storylines sounds like great idea (at least on paper) as it would give both fans that want a more traditional pokemon game and those who want something fresh.\n",
      "Onix better be in Scarlet/Violet……the dream of having a Crystal Onix must come true.\n",
      "I feel like the hill to climb after Arceus is huge, I really liked the independence aspect of the game, the catching mechanics that didn't require you to battle, and no forced encounter in tall grass, which allowed you to see the wild Pokémon. These new games seem to have kept some of these, so I'm eager to find out how it will pan out.\n",
      "*1997* : Legendary Pokemon are elusive to find, and even more difficult to catch. Usually only obtainable after finishing the main game. Non-stop rumours about dubious methods for how to obtain them (underneath trucks etc)\n",
      "*2022* : VVVVRRROOOOMMMMM!!!\n",
      "The new Terastal gimmick looks awesome\n",
      "I’m just happy that Gogoat is finally in another game. Such an under appreciated Pokémon.\n",
      "Let's not deny this, guys: Despite the Wii U being a huge commercial failure, it had a great library of games. It's a huge shame the console itself didn't do very well.\n",
      "Despite its terrible sales, the Wii U made up a huge part of my childhood and I loved it\n",
      "Brings back so many memories of my early childhood to now.  I remember when I was very little, I had the N64 where I first played MARIOKART.  Then I was later given as a present the Game Boy.  And then I remember later on I wanted the GameCube which I got I think either for my birthday or for Christmas.  And that’s where I first played Animal Crossing.  I played the other versions on the other systems as well.  I then asked about a year or two later Santa for a blue DS Lite, and a few years later I got the DS i XL which was a surprise present from my grandma.  And when I graduated from middle school, my grandma got me the Wii as a graduation present.  I eventually also got the 2DS only because it was slightly cheaper and now I have the Nintendo Switch.  I still love them all and Nintendo to this day!  Animal Crossing, Super Mario Bros., MARIOKART, MARIO PARTY, and all the other classics are still my favorite to this day.  And I can’t wait to see Super Nintendo World when it opens at Universal Studios!\n",
      "Thank you Nintendo for making our childhood memorable. I once owned GB Color and Nintendo DS and I had so much fun back in those days.\n",
      "Thank you for this video. Now whenever Nintendo talks about how much of a family friendly company they are - similar to what Sakurai said when he was introducing Terry Bogard for Smash, I'm going to remind them that they once were a love hotel.\n",
      "Glad Nintendo is still fighting in the console bussiness despite their ups and downs over the years! The gaming world is benefited so much with Nintendo in than without.\n",
      "This is probably my favorite game company thank you for making this.\n",
      "Considering the games releasing for other major Consoles, It's Amazing how Nintento still holding it's possition as one of the big 3.\n",
      "What does take time to appreciate how much Nintendo put into the conslas and still makes it family friendly\n",
      "Fun fact:The success of Nintendo switch can be attributed to several factors that have come together in favor of the console.\n",
      "Its hybrid capabilities allow it to appeal to a wide customer base, and it receives plenty of support from both first party and third party developers.\n",
      "Loved the first two and looking forward to the third. A nice alternative to the FPS shooters out there.\n",
      "Funny seeing them shooting ink at the metal part of one of the Salmonid bosses. That boss takes no dmg when hit on it's metal parts, only it's tail can receive damage.\n",
      "Just have to say this is the best “primer” I’ve seen for this game. Fantastic “coverage”, Tom :)\n",
      "i love the idea of just shooting paint in the scenery,\n",
      "that alone was enough for me to love the franchise,\n",
      "i'm glad we already have a third game!\n",
      "It looks really good imo. That's what i love about Nintendo, it's always colourful and incredibly fun to play. Sometimes that's all you need, colours in your life.\n",
      "I recommend using gyroscope. It is the best option to take advantage in this game.\n",
      "I’m looking forward to this one. Thanks for your analysis, though admittedly I don’t get too tripped up by graphics and performance unless it’s abysmal.\n",
      "Splatoon is a lot of fun to jump in and play some games. 3 will be the first i play from its release. Excited.\n",
      "Definitely excited for this all the specs aside. It’s gonna be a lot of fun!\n",
      "I seem to recall Splatoon 2 being a dynamic 900p, so it’s nice to see they were able to optimize the game enough to finally make it up to 1080p\n",
      "The OLED screen is so incredible compared to the original. My flatmate bought one and I can’t look at it without sheer eNvY\n",
      "Watching an adult get so excited about video games is my favorite thing ever. Literally can’t stop smiling, thank you for that ! ❤️\n",
      "The screen is noticeably better so it definitely improves the on the go experience.\n",
      "Haven’t watched this channel in a while, and it’s honestly refreshing to see this level of excitement on YouTube. 👍\n",
      "Makes me feel giddy (Which I haven’t felt in over 10 years)\n",
      "Managed to create a better demo/review than even Nintendo could hope to do with the commercials. Incredible!\n",
      "The oled model definitely looks cool. I'd love to try it out one day.\n",
      "The OLED screen is truly amazing and the games look way more detailed\n",
      "I was curious as to when you'd be able to do this unboxing. We all knew you were getting one but never knew when you'd reveal it. Well worth the wait! 🤩😁\n",
      "Watching this again because my friends got me hooked on video games. And after watching animal crossing and Pokémon streams I kinda have been researching which switch would be better for my technology availability. \n",
      "Now I think I definitely should save up for this one. I like bigger screen option and newer version. Can’t wait to see it available on local stores as I just discovered I could possibly even get it on my mobile carrier contract for less than my iPhone 12. \n",
      "Also I see this as good option when you don’t have smart tv to play games on (like my friends) and I even looked up possible laptop connections. So this one looks right up to my alley. Also for when I’m willing to give my phone a break or just feel like playing video games (which is something I’ve only been discovering few weeks ago)\n",
      "I actually love every single video that you do…I love seeing the joy and legit happiness that you show\n",

      "Life pro tip: You don't need to use your expensive console to test if something is waterproof, just use  paper or something.\n",
      "2:55 I believe the general majority of the case is “waterproof” in sense that rain won’t get in if it lands on it or it gets splashed. But the zipper area is definitely not waterproof, it will not make it through SUBMERSION. Aside from that I think it simply looked simplistic and rather stylish\n",
      "I'm not gonna lie - the part where you just documented your experiences with real people fixing the joycon is so refreshing and I loved this part of the video. Please take us shopping or something lol. I know we're like in a pandemic, but if there's an opportunity to do it safely, please take it :)\n",
      "I love how friendly and cheerful was that Retro employee haha\n",
      "I just love how unexpected everything is going. Better than any Netflix series.\n",
      "A soon as he said the word \"waterproof\" I was like \"Here we go boys\"\n",
      "The screw up was turning it on without making sure it was 100% dry. There's a possibility it would've worked fine\n",
      "retro madness doesn't have much in terms of games, but i will definitely keep an eye on them. it's easy to get retro games here in japan, but, obviously, they're in japanese. i've noticed how hard it it to find a used game store like this on the states, so this is a great find especially since they sell online. thank you.\n",

      "\n",
      "When he was a kid, you could bludgeon 12 people to death with each individual peice of first party hardware and it'd still work fucking flawlessly. Consoles, handhelds, controllers, carts. That shit was made of nokium. It did not break. The number of times I threw a controller. Playstation, you could only throw that once. They were always the most sensitive. Xbox, until the xbox one, you could abuse that shit for five, ten years and still see it work when you weren't seeing red rings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nintendo? Literally murder people with their gear, it did not give a FUCK.\n",
      "Apparently, it's because they're cheaply made. The parts in the joysticks are apparently fairly fragile, and the buttons are suboptimal. Shoulder buttons are reported to give out because of poor soldering and lack of reinforcements. There's also an issue with wiring, as the (+) button and the R button are wired together, while the opposite joycon is wired regularly. \n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, the joycons, while the optimal method to play the Switch in its entirety, are poorly designed for their tasks.\n",
      "Iwata and Reggie were the souls of Nintendo, they embodied why every Nintendo fan loved Nintendo (myself included) every other gaming platform at the time just felt like they were shoving shit down your throat, but when Nintendo was showing off stuff it was like they were popping into your living room to show you the stuff they’ve been working on and were so proud of it, but when they left, all that soul of the company left with them, I’ll always be a Nintendo fan, but that doesn’t mean they’re at the best were I think they can be\n",
      "Remember if Nintendo takes this down then it's canon\n",
      "“You know, when I was a kid. I used to think you were cool” \n",
      "This applies to so many companies and people who turned out to be terrible, I’ve honestly lost count.\n",
      "\"It's not a mistake, it's a feature, Nintendo haters. How are you supposed to play Mario Kart without drift?\".\n",
      "Friendly reminder that the underpayed and overworked customer support nintendo staff is not in fact the one that is in charge of the design of the joy cons nor the culprit of Nintendo's greedy practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be civil, demand your rights but respect the poor human at the other side of the phone.\n",
      "From my experience, my drifting issues have largely been caused by dust. Blowing into the stick with compressed air or using Alcohol to clean them appears to do a pretty decent job at fixing the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still bullshit that we have to deal with this though, and not everyone is as lucky as I am and may need to get their stick repaired.\n",
      "I think without E3, it threw off everything for Nintendo. That’s the place for their biggest presentations and since it didn’t happen this year Nintendo just decided to quietly chug along until they were ready to share more as things come.\n",
      "Those Splatoon joycons are nice!\n",

      "I got my first Switch a month ago, the OLED edition, and i gotta say its one of my favorite consoles ever. I started with the PlayStation 1, then the GameCube, Gameboy Advanced SP, Wii, Xbox 360, 3DS XL, then really got into PC games, and then stopped playing videogames for many years. So it was a delight getting the Switch specially because of the great games it has. My favorite so far have been Fire Emblem Three Houses, Animal Crossing New Horizons, and Smash Ultimate. Also really surprised with Mario Kart 8 its a lot of casual fun! Well this is my paragraph that no one asked for lol. Great video btw!\n",
      "5 years later, the switch library is amazing and I have most of these games. What a nice list of games :) Great video editing as well. Luigi's Mansion's animations/graphics are top tier. Pikmin 3 Deluxe is amazing on that as well and hope more people pick it up. Waiting on Pikmin 4. You have a new subscriber.\n",
      "Xenoblade 3 needs the first spot imo, such a beautiful and amazing game that actually manage to perfect a system that was already in place...\n",
      "definitely dragon dogma. for the best, most complex combat system and great character development so many factors come into play. npc companions learn player behavior, improve, can be borrowed from other players, and then come back with gifts and trophies and new knowledge. Class change at any time. A game that went down with the release of Skyrim, but remains one of the best fantasy RPGs to this day. the sequel, Arisen, finally brought a few more Fast Travel Crystals into play.\n",
      "I'm not a big Mario fan but Paper Mario on Switch is really really good. Picnic Road and so many other soundtracks are sooooo good. Amazing game play too. Clean 8/10\n",
      "Thank you for explaining that Turf war is the casual mode in Splatoon. It seems silly, but so many people judge the entire game on that mode alone.\n",
      "As a OLED switch owner I have to say that it’s a great list BUT I’d include switch sports and mario party superstars in the honorable mentions. Those are the type of games that makes the nintendo switch be different than any other consoles in the market. The local multiplayer of this little thing called nintendo switch is nasty\n",
      "As a person who lived through the dark ages of the wii u im so glad nintendo is back making so cool games for us since the switch released!!!!\n",
      "This looks a lot better than the version they showed last year. Smooth framerate, fast-paced action and over the top silliness. Welcome back Bayonetta. ❤❤\n",
      "I’m hoping Jeanne plays more of a role in this game. It’s going to be the first time that she’ll be active throughout the story without being mind controlled. She really only appeared in the prologue and epilogue last time.\n",
      "Bayonetta deserves even more shine. She may not be trending but this third installment will not disappoint!\n",
      "the fact that Sigurd mentions a way to an “alpha-verse” (with alpha usually meaning first) kinda reinforces the idea that we’re in the universe where Cereza wasn’t sealed away, and the climax of the story could probably involve our main Bayonetta because it’s confirmed we’re gonna meet other Bayonettas. this also kinda ties into how Hellena Taylor tweeted about getting used to not hearing her iconic voice, which could mean the kinda low and seductive one she uses for our main Bayo.\n",
      "Guys if we can see how cool bayonetta looks with her new summons and moves, imagine Jeanne! I can’t wait to see the difference (hoping that Jeanne is playable and maybe even with her actual voice actor) \n",
      "\n",
      "Also I’m really loving the new bg music in the first scene it’s such a bayonetta genre of music\n",
      "The music, the story, the characters, the boss fights in the future… I’m getting hyped for this game! OwO\n",
      "Looks so good !!!!!!! That game clearly looks like platinum was given all the time in the world to make the game as best as they can on the switch , can’t praise Nintendo enough for keeping this franchise alive\n",
      "Nothing beats the hype of a good stylish action game, and this looks like a damn good follow up to two of the best.\n",
      "Bayonetta is gorgeous and her style with Lady Butterfly and her 'armor' is too dope,hope that the combat gets some more content besides the trailer,i'm thinking that some nuances and combat systems will show up in-game....\n",
      "well,gotta rack up some cash to get this one day one! <3\n",
      "At first I wasn´t convinced with the aesthetics of this game but the more i see this trailer the smoother it actually looks and the graphics does not seem bad at all\n",
      "I think I'm the best singer on YouTube. Can't lie.\n",
      "Downloading the DLC from NSO feels a little confusing so maybe they just got too many complaints or questions about it, plus DLC on NSO is a key part of the benefits so they just want to have it covered. My take.\n",
      "Idk man I think it’s smart to tell some parents (who are not gamers) how to download DLC because it allows them to give more exposure to their subscription (which I argue is a great value to those interested in the content it provides).\n",
      "I was recently thinking about what would be next for NSO+EP. And I thought it would be a great idea if Gameboy and Gameboy Colour get launched on the standard tier in September, whilst adding Gameboy Advance and Nintendo GameCube to the Expansion Pack tier in October, one year after the Expansion Pack tier had launched.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also think that your idea of Super Mario Odyssey DLC being added would be brilliant!\n",
      "It was about downloading the DLC included with the NSO Expansion which is done differently than other DLC. And I'm pretty sure it came out to coincide with the new pack of tracks with MK8 Deluxe\n",
      "The problem is it's not telegraphed well to the general user that they have access to the Mario kart tracks for example. They need to upgrade their UX and put it in the switch online section of the OS and also message it better. My guess when I saw this was that they can see loads of people aren't taking advantage of downloading DLC as part of their sub.\n",
      "About the download DLC video: I think it’s more to explain how to download the DLC for free when you’re a NSO+ member. Because I believe many people would think that you’d BUY DLC in the eShop, but there’s an option on the DLC page to download for free. So the video is warranted….. although it should’ve been published last year when NSO+ launched!\n",
      "😅\n",
      "After going through and seeing the user interface, the \"download\" button is not as prominent as the \"proceed to purchase\" button is obvious.  I can see people hitting the purchase button thinking that will get them to where they need to go, but then they see that they have to pay for it and get frustrated.  I have some experience with UX/UI design so that stands out.\n",
      "Wave race being here is pretty damn hype, hoping we get DK64 and uh.. maybe goldeneye soon\n",
      "Virtual boy games for nintendo labo would be nice. As well as optional colour pallete swaps so you can either play in authentic red scale or have it recoloured to include all colours of the rainbow.\n",

      "Tiene buena pinta.\n",

      "A mi me hubiese gustado mucho que le hubiese añadido un modo CPU al igual que lo tiene los Mario Karts o Super Smash Bros como opción para los que no pueden permitirse pagar el online y caso cerrado ✌😁✌\n",
      "Este será mi primer splatoon, si lo compro de otra región para ahorrar dinero aún podré usar el online de México de forma correcta? O tendré problemas 🤔\n",
      "No sé qué tan desacuerdo estaría conque sea gratis...\n",
      "Personalmente prefiero pasar por caja una sola vez y tener prácticamente todo lo disponible.\n",
      "Si el juego se enfoca en multijugador, si debería de ser gratis, esto mismo paso con Halo Infinite, que el multijugador es gratis para todos hasta en PC.\n",
      "Además, al ser gratis impulsaría la compra de membresías online de Nintendo :b\n",

      "Yo estaba viendo cada vez más factible que el Nintendo Direct fuese el día 1. Me monté la película de que Nintendo quería hacer eventos o dar noticias cada semana desde el Partner Showcase hasta el Direct de Septiembre y tenía la sensación de que el Treehouse era como su útimo recurso para cumplir dicho objetivo. Aunque, a saber, incluso siendo la  semana del 12, puede que sea cierto y estas semanas las completen con Treehouses de otros juegos como Mario + Rabbids o Sonic Frontiers.

      "\"Yeah, because you weren't paying attention back then.\"\n",
      "Easily your most cutting line to date.\n",
      "I really respect how Scott is a big Nintendo fan, but isn't fooled and pledging blind allegiance to them for nostalgia's sake. So many of the decisions they make can be so blatantly anti consumer and it blows my mind how some fans will hop in the line of fire to block any shots sent Nintendo's way; being extra dramatic and hardheaded no matter how egregious their actions may be.\n",
      "This video has the \"Scott the Woz\" feel all over it. It is definitely a video is it sure has been \"Five Years In\". 10/10\n",
      "It’s been over a year and I STILL see Mario 3d all stars on store shelves\n",
      " and Breath of the Wild came out 4 years apart and both cost 60$ makes me unbelievably sad\n",
      "I’m going to be legit sad when the Switch era ends. This is the last Nintendo console that came out before i graduated. I’m having less and less time to play games but the few hours i put at them bring me tons of joy.\n",
      "I hope i can have time for the Switch 2.\n",
      "I’m seriously impressed how Scott can talk for over 2 hours and still keep it interesting. Even if I can’t watch it in 1 go I still come back to watch the whole thing\n",
      "This was a joy to watch. I really like this series. Just wrapping up a whole year in sections is a great way to look back. This year felt pretty monotone for me. I wasn't over hyped for anything and as a pokemon fan PLA was cool but BDSP felt janky. Kirby was incredible. Kingdom hearts being cloud versions was the biggest let down for me though.\n",
      "Can't wait! Cool to see some prolonged gameplay!\n",
      "3:19 Something I noticed that is SO small, but such a good detail is instead of abruptly stopping, they gradually skid to a stop. Amazing detail :)\n",
      "Is it just me or does it look like everyone will be able to dodge roll now and not just duelie mains? I think Splatoon three is gonna be easy to pick up but hard to master, nothing wrong with that though! Can't wait to meet everybody in the turf war!\n",
      "0:48 New inkzoka looks cool, looks very strong and the 3 shot limit really helps balance it out a bit. My Question however is if the rainmaker will take on this kind of “triple spiral shot” that the inkzoka has, as the rainmaker always takes after the cannon like special in each game. Would make for interesting ranked matches\n",
      "The specials are looking more aggressive than Splatoon 2's while not being totally OP like Splatoon 1's were. Eeltail Alley's looking quite well-designed for something so basic and open. The Stringer's looking like it could be more flexible than the old Chargers, but it might not have charge storage when morphed.\n",
      "\n",
      "-And I'm calling it: the vacuum special's going to be called the Sucker Shot.- Well, that was a disappointment. And after they'd done so well with other names like \"Killer Wail\", \"Echolocator\", \"Bubbler\", \"Inkjet\" etc..\n",
      "I really love the added player titles and medals awarded to the players at the end of each match. Not to mention, the music is HARD! Just 4 and a half months and the wait will finally be over!\n",
      "What I have gleamed from this is that I'll definitely be playing turf war a lot more in this installment. The specials look like they actually benefit turf war compared to the previous versions, and will definitely be a lot more fun overall in ranked modes. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love the aggressive approach to the specials too reverting back to what splatoon offered. It gives people a chance who normally wouldn't be able to dominant due to lack of necessary skill or just going against weapons that absolutely oppress them. I personally play short ranged weapons and it gets tough to approach when you are constantly matched up with mid to long-ranged weapons when your weapon doesn't have the kit to contend. Definitely a plus seeing brush being able to grapple, because in certain do or die situations the brush may be the last line of defense and deserves a chance to shine without constantly having to wait until opponents approach you.\n",
      "I can’t even! This game is going to be so good! The added player titles, the new music absolutely slaps. And the new victory animations and just. Everything else.\n",
      "This gameplay is awesome, and I am loving the music being played, especially now or never, it sounds more intense than the other splatoon games, really gives off the feeling that it is the last minute of the match, and the team that is losing must make a comeback fast.\n",
      "I love the new display and gear. The new abilities fit the “City of Chaos” get up. I like how it shows what weapons we should expect to have their specials. Can’t wait to see if they release a test fire.\n",
      "Pin\n",
      "The fact this came from Kotaku means it can't be taken serious.\n",
      "Soo... let me get this straight. A person that refuses to reveal their identity (-1 point) tells a very fishy story (-1 point) without any proof (-1 point) for a joke that wasn't even sexual harassment (-1 point). Then, she revealed her(?) tragic story to Kotaku (-1 point).\n",

      "You don’t get to say Stray is a racist game and have me take you seriously. One of innumerable examples. If people really are doing criminal/inappropriate things at work then punish them accordingly, but until someone with a shred of integrity reports it I will withhold judgement.\n",
      "If she thinks a couple of inappropriate jokes over the course of 9 years  is a \"harrowing experience\", she must live a very sheltered life.\n",
      "Someone making sexual jokes about fictional characters in a chat is not sexual harassment, it's not even directed at her. She wants it to be harassment specifically because she's a woman who was part of the chat.\n",

      "Perfectly said. I’ve been bringing up stuff like this for years, and I absolutely despise this double standard. You can love their games all you want (I certainly do), but Nintendo as a company is seriously one of the worst in the industry. Stop discounting everything they do just because you have good memories of them. This needs to be fixed not just at Nintendo, but everywhere.\n",
      "Good stuff man. People being inconsistent is the only consistent part of the internet.\n",
      "When I was a kid in the early 90s you could still write a sloppy hand written 4 page letter with crayon drawings and send it to Nintendo of America and they would immediately write you back answering every single question you had no matter how dumb it was, and complementing your crappy drawings in detail. I think my Dad might still have some of their response letters in his desk. Those days are long gone.\n",
      "You’re 100% right. Everyone has to decide for themselves how serious this stuff is but at the end of the day there’s a lot of virtue signalling going on. Also, while we’re at it, let’s all admit that as much as people like to hate Kotaku, at least they’re willing to report this kind of stuff.\n",
      "Here’s a hot take: Most hardcore gamers/tech workers who would in “nerd” stuff are going to be a bunch of socially awkward weirdos. This is why these things happen at all gaming companies and places like Gencon where they virtue signal but these virtue signalers are the ones who commit assault and/or harassment 🤷‍♂️\n",

      "It's good to see that you're always willing to speak your mind. In a time where anybody that speaks up on anything, will be bashed and harassed for being honest. The direction things are going in general on speaking out is sad.  Appreciate you and your brutal honesty brother.  🙌\n",
      "I like Nintendo games but not people who commit sexual harassment, which happens in too many places. Men and women do act in unsolicited ways towards others.\n",
      "Congratulations RGT you’re finally learning what trends are. It seems Nintendo hasn’t trended negatively like Activision has so their opinions haven’t been altered.\n",
      "I miss the days when you unlocked these things by playing the game at your own pace. Characters and stages were always cool rewards for beating the game’s challenges.\n",

      "I do really appreciate how new characters still get hand drawn art to match everyone else. If all the dlc adds new stages, gear, and characters, then I’ll be coming back to this game for a long time.\n",
      "It’s about time Daisy came to this game, she should’ve been here from the drop, I am so hyped\n",
      "This is a bare minimum update that should have been there day one. I want to see MUCH bigger updates in the future\n",
      "I'd never argue with new content entirely, so I'm grateful and happy they've added what they added here. I think if the game wants to see a potential sector for longevity, it would need to have a Spectator Mode and possibly proper 4v4 Online (where all players can be remote) so that there could be a tourney scene.\n",
      "I myself would be hosting them regularly with a Spectator Mode client, but it could go eSports if they had a tournament scene like that. But like I say, I'm happy for any additional content being added to the game and I hope they'll consider modes/features for the updates to come!\n",

I need to play Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Torna over again in true 1080p or at 1440p whether it be 30fps or 60fps. I just want them to be clear with further and more saturated draw distances and that dynamic resolution removed.  Of course this would benefit many other games but I haven't NG+ XC2 because I am hopeful I'll get to re-experience improved on new hardware.\n",
      "I actually feel Nintendo should probably leave their next gen design choice at the Nintendo Switch level. It's the perfect system whether you want a home console, portable or both. They should just focus on upgrading hardware on each gen or giving it refreshes with better design implementations like joycons with pro controller sticks. I'd also like to see more things the Switch could be paired with ..like linking to discord and Spotify and having them run in the background.\n",
      "Graphics do matter... but it's more tied to the visual style and aesthetics that are implemented. I don't care about SUPER REALISTIC graphics, I just want stable eye-pleasing visuals with amazing gameplay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look no further than how poorly some of the earlier 'realistic' graphics have aged on previous consoles, while games with a more unique art style have remained timeless.\n",
      "Given Nintendo's track record with moves that make sense, they will use this feature sparingly as they did with cloud gaming and file transfers.\n",
      "It must be difficult for nintendo to decide on how to move on from the Switch.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would like to see the next console (hybrid hopefully) support switch cartridges still.\n",
      "I wonder if No Man's Sky coming to Switch in October will incorporate some of this 'new' tech we've been seeing more of.

Likely will either be a pretty solid 30FPS or 30FPS with frame drops and low res. I suspect the low rest automatically in either case but I never played the game so I'm interested to possibly give it a try if it's a half decent port.\n",
      "I still love my Switch, but after owning the Steam Deck for a couple of weeks I have to say - Valve is doing a substantially better job supporting the Steam Deck then Nintendo is the Switch. I've already got more updates that have made the system even better in a couple weeks then Nintendo has in 5 years. Nintendo needs to take a page out of Valve's playbook here.\n",
      "I’d love to see Monolith apply this tech, either FSR 1.0 or DLSS when the newer model drops, in an update to Xenoblade Chronicles 2. All the Xenoblade games are in my ever-growing backlog, so I think I’ll wait to see if this actually happens 🤞\n",

      "I've had my Steam Deck for about a month now and your reaction to the weight was EXACTLY the same reaction I had. Everyone says it's \"so big\" but honestly when you hold it in your hand and feel that weight it makes everything go away. Amazing handheld.\n",
      "Personally I’d much rather a free carrying case then fancy unnecessary packaging. I appreciate a company that’s forgo paying the extra bucks on packaging and placing it into something more functional to the consumer in the long run.\n",
      "While I really have no plans to get a Steam Deck, I'm hoping that a little healthy competition for the Switch will make Nintendo step up their game with the next Switch (or with some sort of Pro model like the fans have been crying for for years)\n",
      "The Steam Deck is an excellent friendly competitor. Nintendo's advantage is many great first Ip and tons of third parties. Not to mention name recognition, but the stream deck could make Nintendo focus on creating a Nintendo Switch Pro or Nintendo Switch 2 that has more power which I think is great because it puts more pressure on Nintendo to do better.\n",
      "I think fancy premium packaging would be cool, but I like the fact that they are trying to be less wasteful in comparison to other businesses.\n",
      "The packaging feels really nice and Valve-like. They made it simple and homey (if you get me) and it feels like a homemade dinner in comparison to the Switches package which would be compared to a fancy restaurant. The outside doesn’t matter, it’s the inside that matters; this couldn’t be more true with the Steam Deck!\n",
      "While the Steam Deck's performance handling these AAA games is impressive I'd really like to see more content creators focus on other aspects. The Steam Deck is a fantastic way for first timers to try PC gaming and it really has so much more to offer.\n",
      "Where I feel it really shines is the extensive catalog of lesser known, smaller, and past titles.\n",
      "(Basically pick any random, old, game and it will likely allow settings comparable to the rerelease/remaster releases that you have to wait for and pay extra on console. Older games often look much better on smaller screens too. So many should be fantastic on that little thing.)\n",
      "One of my favorite uses for my Steam Deck was loading emudeck and having the virtual console I've always wished the Switch would be!\n",

      "He specified \"One Box exclusives\", in the market those exclusives are necessary in order to get subscribers, if all the services are the same there won't be no point in services, it's like with Netflix and Diseny +, exclusive content but that is allowed to come out on Blue ray from Disney, but not on Netflix. Same thing for services.\n",
      "I love how some people are missing the point of his statement. He literally means “one platform” Xbox been doing this for years and now even PlayStation is slowing doing it\n",
      "You're constantly putting out extremely well curated and delivered content. Thank you 💯\n",
      "I think Phil is referring to games coming to PC and mobile. As for Xbox games, it means the same but also where ever game pass is too. I seen a lot of PlayStation fanboys acting like Xbox will go 3rd party and all Xbox games will be on PlayStation\n",
      "Console exclusives aren't going anywhere. They would be insane to split market share off of their hardware, their ecosystem and ultimately their control. Nintendo has dominated both Sony and Microsoft this generation with the unreal success of the Switch. They are the proof in the pudding that hardware and exclusives are still what drive the consumer towards the platform.\n",
      "Destin, I think I enjoy your content because it pushes rational debates or argument. To the issue of exclusives. I think the strategy of MS has already been spelled out. \n",
      "\n",
      "What I think MS plans to do is make the console the foundation of their business strategy. They will have console exclusives, but they will not restrict their games to just the console device which is Sony's strategy. It just means they will release on multiple devices from PCs, to TV's, to mobile phones, and through cloud. MS has expanded agreesively.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I personally do not think their games will go to Sony consoles like most people tend to think because Sony are their competition.\n",
      "I think it's a time of wait and see. Imo, we're seeing all these investments because interest rates are low. If at the end of the process, Sony for example don't see financial gain, I can easily see it reverting. We're all hoping this works as gamers, but none of us know what the end result will be.\n",
      "Phil Spencer said the day of the press conference welcoming Bethesda into the fold that it was about making games available on platforms where game pass exist so this is not anything new he's staying consistent.\n",
      "I would love to boot up my console and swap from Battlefield to Halo to Spiderman to Mario Kart to Pokémon within the same ecosystem but I just don't think something like that will happen unless there is a third party neutral console that has all the subscriptions for each major player on it\n",

      "What do you think about the FUTURE of console EXCLUSIVES? Thanks for watching and LIKING the video! <3\n",
      "What would be the point in multiple consoles if they are all the same then?  We might as well have a one console nation.   No competition or reasons to buy different consoles.   Exclusives give each console an identity and reasons to invest into a particular console.  There’s a reason Netflix has different movies from HBO Max.\n",
      "I believe most exclusives will be timed exclusives. Companies like Nintendo will never ever have their first party titles on other platforms.\n",
      "Xbox says “game pass is the future…. Because we have it”….then “exclusives are doomed… because we have less than none”\n",
      "I disagree. Console exclusives is what separates the companies and hardware apart. If exclusive games are a thing of the past then their is no need for a PlayStation, Xbox or Switch. Everyone will become a PC gamer. \n",
      "\n",
      "In a perfect world Sony, Microsoft & Nintendo will join forces and Sony will engineer the hardware with Microsoft’s wallet and ambition for higher specs and Nintendo’s passion for innovation. Unfortunately, we don’t live in such a world.\n",
      "If all games were on one console that would eliminate competition and create a monopoly.\n",
      "Considering how well Nintendo exclusives sell on all their hardware and especially so on the Switch I find Phil's comments laughable\n",
      "I have had a love hate relationship with console exclusives. I get why they exist and why they draw consumers to a specific platform. This coming Phil along Xbox's track record concerning their exclusives since around 2013 and up, haven't exactly been praised as PlayStation's have been, this is more corporate weasel words. \n",
      "\n",
      "Xbox has cannibalized and quite frankly wore out their once golden franchises. Halo, Gears of War, um...I'm sure I'm forgetting some others. The line is going to get blurry with where titles between the respective console manufactures games end up for consumption. \n",
      "\n",
      "Xbox has doing really well with Game Pass, but they are missing that killer app for the system.\n",
      "Ok 1) Phil is right as far a exclusives go. Because they are also on pc. So there will be no exclusives. \n",
      "2) multiple devices references pc, tv, phone, console. So no they DON'T NEED SONY'S CONSOLE FOR SALES\n",

      "PINNED COMMENT:  This video took a little while to put together. Sorry for the delay, but let me know what your favorite reveal was at Gamescom 2022\n",
      "Apart from Lies of P and Calisto Protocol, i really found \"Atlas Fallen\" to be really interesting, surprised no one is talking about this new game reveal. Also absolutely thrilled to learn that Lies of P will release day 1 on Game Pass, one of the few benefits of owning both Consoles that you get to enjoy the best of both worlds.\n",
      "Lies of P looks incredible also Dead island looks like it could be good High on life looks very fun it was a good showcase lots of game but also lots of ads.\n",
      "This was a very solid Gamescom, especially loved the bit of trolling we got from Kojima. Seems like this event just keeps getting better every year\n",
      "Favorite reveal was gameplay of Lies of P coming to gamepass day 1😊😊😊😊\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes looks and feels like it's gonna be awesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely playing it, but yea 2023 is stacked.\n",
      "I knew something was missing out of my daily life. Thanks for the vids Jay. Your work and content is so underrated.\n",
      "Atlas Fallen, The Lords Of The Fallen, and Lies of P were my favorite take aways from the show. Well Where Winds Meet too but I'm hesitant since I don't know if it will release on Xbox or not.\n",
      "High On Life is Conker but as a first person shooter I''m hyped for that game. Lies of P is the successor of Bloodborne. Callisto Protocol looking good. Sonic Frontiers I'm impressed. Atlas Fallen and Dead Island 2 oh yea! 👍\n",
      "Pretty good show overall can’t wait for lies of P man 🔥🔥\n",
      "I agree that the show was average, but the Dead Island 2 reveal made my day. Dead Island and Dead Island Riptide are the most addictive zombie games I have played. I played both of them all the way to the end.\n",
      "Thanks for watching! What consoles do you currently own?\n",
      "Just bought the series S. It looks great, loads fast and plays next gen games. I'll upgrade in a couple years when the series X is easier to find. It's worth it people\n",
      "Series s is PERFECT for PlayStation players who want to expand their gaming library. After getting my ps5 I wanted a cheap way into the Xbox ecosystem and this has been an amazing console that I honestly grew to appreciate more than the ps5 due to the small size and price\n",
      "The deal breaker for me is not having a disc drive when I've amassed a huge collection of physical discs. That's why I got the Series X. However, for anyone new to Xbox or someone who doesn't own physical discs, this is a great purchase.\n",
      "I've owned both and the Series S has a special place in my heart. I love the X but unless you're rocking a TV that supports 4K120 w/ VRR, the Series S is just fine. Also, it's SO tiny and it's amazing what a quiet beast it is. But definitely buy the storage expansion card, regardless of which one you buy.\n",
      "The Series S is plain amazing, especially with GamePass and if you are into backward compatibility gaming. I've just completed the entire Gears series on 360 because I never got to play them back in the day (Gears 1 to Judgment) and it's been a pure blast. You can also find an online list of all the games who received an FPS boost (including Xbox and Xbox 360 games) so there's that too. Some are now locked at 60 and some are even at 120 FPS. Yes my last name is Spencer how did you know?\n",
      "The only next gen console I could find was this one. Have owned it for about a year. 0 regrets. Would buy it again. Its amazing. Its form factor blows my mind. So tiny but so powerful\n",
      "I definitely have no complaints with the Series S. From what I've seen 1440 is still more than adequate for graphics and it runs super smooth and is still a very quick console.\n",
      "I was totally blown away by my series s \n",
      "I still can’t believe what you can get there for 300 bucks\n",
      "Still I upgraded to series x because I’m used to pc quality and the extra fps and native resolution is totally worth investing the extra money \n",
      "Still I would totally go for the series s. \n",
      "It’s super quiet performance is mind blowing And it’s pretty small \n",
      "I guess this time Xbox is superior to PlayStation even though everybody is freaking out about ps5 and is probably sleeping on the new Xbox consoles though they’re way better \n",
      "X is more powerful and the s is a absolute price performance killer \n",
      "\n",
      "I didn’t expect to be that happy with Xbox after being used to a high end pc\n",
      "needless to say that the Series S is actually easy to find and purchase, while getting a Series X for not more than original retail price is difficult\n",
      "Xbox just announced the Xbox Series S as a suprise, so unfortunately it's missing in this video! The price is also announced, $499 for the Xbox Series X and $299 for the Xbox Series S! What do you think, will you buy the Series X or S?\n",

The Sony exclusives are the one thing that I’m missing on my Xbox but having both of them along with the switch would be a harmony of mathematical precision lol I think all consoles are wonderful in their perspective but together it’s gamers paradise .\n",
      "I’m a fan of gaming, not a fan of a specific company. I enjoy both systems!\n",
      "My 1st console was the original PS.  Loved it so much that I stayed with them and upgraded to PS2.  Somewhere in there I picked up a used xbox because my 1st Lan party with Halo just blew me away.  Then 3rd gen consoles came and both the price of games and consoles went above what I was willing to spend at that time so I turned to Nintendo and was happy to play their handheld systems.  Getting the Xbox series X was an easy decision for me.  I have Nintendo Switch for my exclusives, strategy, and rpg needs while the Xbox satisfied my craving for FPS and games that required higher processing and graphical power.\n",
      "Honestly for most people it comes to whatever your friends have\n",

      "You quickly mentioned that online depends on where our friends also play.  That is a win for the Xbox, because it has direct integration with PC.  You can chat with anyone on PC, but also directly play with them in a slew of GamePass games that silently support cross-play between PC and Xbox.  Playstation is doubling down on the walled-garden approach to keep people buying their brand through sunken cost and social ostricization (perpetuating the console wars, really).  No brainer, Microsoft is the one doing far better on supporting multiple platforms and opening the experinece to a larger audience, including online.\n",

      "I was once in line at a GameStop to buy a used PS3 when a guy got in line behind me to trade in his PS3. So i bought the PS3 off the guy for less then what GameStop was selling them and more then what he would have received from the store. We both won on that day.\n",
      "As someone I used to work for GameStop, my advice is to always buy the Used system over the Refurbished ones. The refurbished ones were broken at one point, and whoever fixes them doesn't do a great job.\n",
      "I was a manager at Electronics Boutique 20 years ago and we had the same problem with the PS2 “company refurbs” and they usually didn’t operate. I told my staff to unpack them when they came in, immediately mark them as defective and ship them back out. We had gotten burned too many times, and I wasn’t gonna put my customers through that anymore.\n",
      "I sold my Xbox One X a few months ago (on eBay), and whew... this video makes it seem like I really sold mine for far, far too cheap!  I'm one of those people that keeps everything -- including the foam wrap, plastic bags, and twist ties -- so the console looks pretty darn good once I get it all back together.  I can imagine that the only reason you'd want to buy from Gamestop is just the ease if something is wrong, and familiarity.  Also, they don't know me, but they know Gamestop.\n",
      "I worked at GameStop for 5 years and that is by far one of the most unacceptable packing jobs I’ve seen. The first console you opened was likely in terrible shape when it was traded in; it’s common for those refurbished ones to have panels replaced or be opened up and fixed from the inside out. I bet it’s missing the rubber pieces on the bottom because it’s been resurfaced in some way. The second console was likely just a trade in tested by an employee for under 5 minutes. With these consoles, very little is done before they’re repackaged and sold.\n",
      "Something to keep in mind i had to replace the thermal past and pads because the home screens of most games were enough to make it over heat and power off\n",
      "I used to work in a used game store. We would refurbish GameStop refurbished consoles literally daily from people who had them for just a little over a month. GameStop refurbishes are known for taking shortcuts at every possible turn, and using the cheapest replacement parts available. We had a local GameStop that was notorious for ignoring thermal paste on literally everything they did. So much so we put out a social media post letting everyone in our area know we would redo the thermal paste in any GameStop console they purchased within a week with proof, for $10. Fuck GameStop\n",
      "I used to work at gamestop and I can say they didn't give us enough packing supplies to ship out orders\n",
      "I work at GameStop, and we aren't supposed to package it like that. The price is high cause we are low supply of consoles but everything else is pretty accurate. ahaha\n",
      "FYI, for those of us who miss out on a sale by a few days...if an item goes on sale a few days after you bought it, just call up customer service and politely ask for a partial refund. Gamestop is usually pretty good about giving you the difference in cost between what you paid and the current price of the console.\n",
      "I hope there will be more games hitting 120fps at at least 1440p. If not with the Series X, then definately release a Pro mid-gen refresh asap.\n",
      "I would love to see a series x pro version with a bit more power to run flight simulator properly especially with so many addons  that tax the system and a increase in FPS for flight sim would be great .\n",
      "I think a pro series x with wifi 6 and  more powerful chip would be nice. They could keep the same ssd\n",
      "A pro version of the Xbox and playstation is something that isn't needed. They are still making cross generation games leading into the end of 2022 and possibly 2023. If there is going to be a refresh, it may not be until 2025 or 2026.\n",
      "I think game pass will have 35 million subscribers at the end of next year. All the game releases and activision/blizzard games in game pass will surely add alot to it!\n",

      "The reason they said large and open space instead of largest map is because if you look at their past games and you measure the square footages of every location and put them together that may be bigger. None of their past games have had an open world. Their other games usually have one big world segmented into multiple locations. In this game it's actually one open world so it's the largest open space of any game they created. And they did say that this open world is bigger than Prey.\n",
      "There is no \"loop hole\" for how Death Stranding made it to Game Pass PC. As some have already commented, 505 owns the PC rights, so they're free to put it on anything they want. Sony owns the console rights to DS, so this is why it will probably never come to Xbox consoles, unfortunately.\n",

      "Personally I'm stoked for the family plan.\n",
      "That makes sense that they are going into the holiday season that they want to maximize any sales for that.  So that is really only going to be like 3 months only.\n",
      "Would be nice if the Family Plan had different levels that we could pay for !!\n",
      "\n",
      "So we can pay for how many people we want to share with in our family, so if I only have 1 person I want to share with then it should be cheaper than a Family Plan that allows 5 people to share.....This would be Great imo !!\n",

And ps5 so I'm good on games lol 😆 dude I have thousands of games already on both platforms 🤣. So yea and atm I'm back on forza horizon 4 and 5 and elden ring and dark souls 3 and demon souls remake. So I'll be busy for a while so if they wanna sort things out for us on GP I'm ok and I'm sure many of us are.. xbox has been really good to us ya know. They take a huge hit just for us to have fun and that's why I love xbox. They truly try to help us out with lowering the prices of the series S and X and keeping game pass cheap and keeping a ton of games on it. Yeah games on Xbox store is higher than picking up the disk for ps4 n ps5 ect but still they do good by us with Game pass n the cheap as hell monthly bill and the already low price of the series S n X...  and i don't understand why ppl are shit talking the Series S.... dude I love mine I have 3 of em 🤣 🤣.  And it can do 4k Microsoft already said it does lmao.. and all ya gotta do is when you plug it up to your TV go to settings display settings and select 4k 60hz or 4k 120hz what ever your TV or monitor does.. and then start a Game... and then take the TV remote and hit the OK button.... your TV will tell you what the series S is putting out to it... mine shows 4k 60hz Hdr10 DD and the games look beautiful and smooth.. yeah it's not as nice as the series X but it's Def not 1080P it's a higher resolution 100% and I don't see how someone can get 1080p by looking at it lol.. 1080p don't look that damn sharp n good lmao... and just look at the ps4 pro specs... the ps4 pro is a 4k correct??.... well the series S has better specs has better hardware... the same or a Lil more Tflops as well... the series is is a Zen 2 which is a AMD 3k series a RTX machine... it will do 4k just not as well as its bigger brother the X...\n",

Yet according to the customer it was never exposed to water and he was trying to scam him out of his warranty… customers will be customers. Thankfully many are honest!\n",

He said it was working fine and that I was the last person to touch the computer so it must have been something I'd done.  I keep snap shots of before and after repairs of my work and keep a printout with all my work orders.  I said to him that his system didn't even have an HDD in it when it was repaired and only had one SSD in it.  He mumbled something and said he'd just take his business elsewhere.\n",

      "Gaz is spot on in regards to Xbox' marketing. It is an Xbox problem and their marketing in many european countries is either non-existent or incredibly limited. They have a good product with a good service and software, yet in many europeans markets they are being outsold 10-1 because they either don't know how or where to market their product or their budget is super limited.\n",

      "Hey guys, love your work. I went to pre-order Modern Warfare 2 from the Xbox store yesterday, and was quite surprised to find that it’s priced at £69.95 - have you covered this? I think it may be the first £70 Xbox game I’ve come across.\n",
      "When a game says their new game is bigger than their last game, The people whining saying \"A bigger map means the game wont be dense!\" Are just complaining to complain. They do not know shit if the game is more dense or not. That is just a deflection of an actual reaction or thought with any real substance. \n",
      "I guess I am just sick of these people who are sick of studios being proud of making their games bigger than their previous. If the game is not out or being played by reviewers at least... Then lets just be patient and wait until we are playing it instead of saying some BS comments are are being made up out of complete guesses pretty much. \n",

      "I think in the future the value of having the series x will grow exponentially, when you look at the number of studios Microsoft has been acquiring, and with fewer cross gen titles limiting Devs from using the full power of the next gen consoles.\n",
      "I’m very happy with my Series S, and I’ve been all about physical media before I got it. I do plan on getting a series X eventually, but I’ve just been playing digital games on my Xbox One most of the time because of Game Pass Ultimate. After thinking about it, I realized my physical library on Xbone was substantially smaller than my PS4 library or Switch library, so I didn’t really feel bad about getting the Series S and an external hard drive. Even though my 360 library was pretty big, I’ve been able to get a lot of my favorites on sale for like $3 each digitally. When the Series X becomes more available and becomes a bit cheaper, I’ll get one but for now I’m really enjoying my Series S\n",
      "As someone on a budget the series s is great game pass makes it really great especially with the deals u can get and just using external hard drives are a better option because transferring games is better than paying half the price of the console for the ssd so yeah if u have more money maybe get the series x but it just depends on ur situation\n",
      "I have a decent amount of physical games from the original Xbox, 360, and one so I feel justified getting the Series X especially because it has superior fps at 4K resolution. The problem right now is many games are cross gen so nothings really pushed the series X to its limits yet. If you still have a one X and plan to get a Series X later and can wait, you can update the Internal HDD to a SDD on the One X. It’ll load games twice as fast as before but still probably twice as long as the Series S. The One X has a better graphics card than the series S, previous games optimized for the One X will look better on the One X than on the series S. However cross platform games are probably going to have a better FPS than the X do to the better CPU. There’s a lot that goes into this stuff. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another factor to consider is the quality of your tv. I’ll be looking to pair my Series X with a new OLED tv here soon and then I’m 200% sure I’ll feel justified with the purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also I game a lot so 30, 60, 120 frames a second… I notice the difference. And in no way shape or form would I feel justified having a next gen console (Series S) that can’t even keep up with my old 4K tv.\n",
      "It really depends on what your main platform is. If your main is Playstation, I've seen a lot go with the Series S to get the exclusives. Most that main a PS5 don't want to pay the extra.\n",
      "Thank you for sharing your experience with these consoles and not \"fan boying\". Speaking your truth will help alot of people who are on a budget. People constantly spread the narrative of digital games are horrible but why when the majority of the world doesn't but movies or music. I'm all for digital downloads and will only purchase physical games if it's attached to a special edition that I'm truly a fan of\n",
      "In your own words: \"Do I really want an XBOX? No. Do I really need an XBOX? No. But I feel like I work hard and I deserve it.\" In reality, since the day you stepped onto the XBOX Series platform, you have been trying to convince yourself that you need something you didn't really want, that's foolish logic. The next time you don't want something, don't buy it because you think you work hard and deserve it.\n",
      "I don't have a Series X yet, and although Series S is a great console, the fact is all digital is a no go for me. The reason is that I have a good collection of XBOX 360 and XBOX One physical games, and some of them, such as older Forza Horizon or Forza Motorsport games are not available to buy digitally anymore due to  license issues. So the only way of playing those games is using the disc. I would be happy with a Series So with disc drive, but as this is not an option, I'll have to go with the Series X.\n",
      "Another point is that, although GamePass is great (I had it for two years and experienced great games, including Halo Infinite), I think it is a bit too expensive. If it was $80 per year, as the Live Gold was, it would be a no brainer, but at $15 per month ($180 per year) I think it is too expensive. You can use that money and buy over 7 AAA games on physical or digital sale for that price (assuming an average cost of $25 per game).\n",
      "I bought a Series S when it first came out and a 3 year gamepass subscription. Was pretty impressed with the little beast but soon ran into the lack of free space to install games.  So I decided to sell the S and buy the Series X. Had the X now for a year  but the other day I suddenly realised that I hadn't turned on my series X for a week. And before that it was just sporadically. So decided to sell.  BUT,  I didn't want to completely move away from gaming and I managed to find an absolute awesome deal on a Series S.  140 euros with 2 controllers and 1 of those controllers is the 20th anniversary edition.  Going to sell that,  which will make my Series S end price probably around 60 euros. Can't get better than that!  For casual gamers,. like myself,  the Series S is a fantastic console.\n",
      "Big mistake!  I own both the X Box Series X and PS 5 and alot of the older games from previous gen releases run and look alot better on the X Box Series X.  Even some of the current gen titles look better on X Box Series X.  Also, Microsoft's recent buy outs with Bethesda, Activision and potentially other gaming software companies means future releases like COD and Skyrim releases may be X Box Series X exclusives.\n",
      "Got my Series X on Friday, and I’m really impressed with it. The visuals are jaw dropping.\n",
      "I went from a One S to the Series X and the jump to 4K 60fps is pretty significant, everything feels much smoother and everything loads faster (thank god for SSDs). The only issue is that there aren't really any games out right now designed specifically for the Series X with the exception of the medium aha\n",
      "I've been a life-long PlayStation fan, but after looking at the beauty and power of the new Series X, I just may get one.  I'm enjoying the PS5 too.\n",
      "As a huge PlayStation fan, That packaging is another level 👀\n",
      "I’ve had my series X for a week and I’m still in love with it, the visuals and overall gameplay of the games are amazing, I can’t stop playing Microsoft flight sim because of how beautiful it looks and how well the console runs the game. Strongly recommend if your an Xbox fan\n",
      "Great job here. Man, that is so beautifully lit, filmed and cut. It looks literally perfect! Would you ever consider making some tips how to film like that? Re the Series X, it's such a shame supply sucks. I've been lucky enough to source one, but it's such a wonderful machine that should be in so many more houses!\n",
      "Just got the Xbox and my friend got the ps5 and honestly they did amazing with both consoles it’s at the point in time that it doesn’t really matter what system you have unless u want exclusives all games now a days are crossplay love both systems 💯💯💯\n",

      "Yeah but if you buy a rechargeable battery pack for the XB controller, you can actually charge it up using your same charger that your phone uses plugged into the wall. The PS controller will only charge when it’s connected directly to the console.\n",

      "As a Playstation fan I really hope the deal goes through! They’ve relied on cod marketing to boost their sales since the beginning of the last gen. Sony will have to innovate and become more attractive in other more interesting things than COD.\n",
      "This is ridiculous does Sony not understand the deal is going through no matter what it’s business PlayStation does it all the time\n",
      "I personally like that Xbox is being so aggressive. I got tired of them playing nice a long time ago, especially considering that Sony has never extended to them the same courtesy.\n",
      "The part at 5:00 explains it clearly, this is why I have such a huge problem with Sony right now. The sense of entitlement and pettiness coming from them is infuriating. Seems like this is all about gamepass and other moves by MS changing the industry, and now Sony is upset because they have to compete on more even ground and are resentful about it.\n",
      "that's the console war we need. This kind of competition gets the best out of both companies, and it means Ws for all of us consumers\n",
      "I primary  play on PS but recently got back into Xbox for the first time since Xbox 360 so I’m happy to see Xbox actually do well because it pushes Sony to do better.  When I see twitter I see so much venom from both sides and it’s super sad to see, i just love video games man why can’t we just enjoy it.\n",
      "I have both PlayStation and Xbox, and I like how this competitive climate is forcing change on both sides. Microsoft was foundering during the last generation, so they introduced Game Pass, which forced Sony to step up their game with PS Plus. Competition ultimately benefits the consumer. Things are getting spicy with these acquisitions, but being on both platforms, I'm content to let them duke it out for my money.\n",
      "Boy, that escalated quickly. I mean, that really got out of hand fast. – Ron Burgundy.\n",
      "You gotta love how most of Sony’s arguments boil down to “we’re scared that Microsoft will not allow COD on PlayStation and we know we will lose 50% of our player base over it” meanwhile exclusivity is their whole business model\n",
      "Documents like this are why Microsoft have the best lawyers in the world. They go through it with a fine tooth comb and they’re like “yep. Send it.”\n",

      "On the series x I hate how if you have a enhanced game saved somewhere other than the internal or the hard drive for the back it will always want too update the same games over and over\n",
      "The fact they managed to get Lies of P into Game Pass day one is nuts at this point Xbox can damn near get any 3rd party game into Game Pass\n",
      "Microsoft is helping developers financially to get their games finished and out to millions of people. Sony is not doing that at all and people are clocking on to it and shifting to Xbox. Especially when COD is on Game Pass every time a new one comes out.\n",
      "You know Dirt I can honestly say I'm literally overwhelmed with good games on games pass just finished Sniper elite 5 loved it bout to play Thymesia and midnight fight express and I absolutely know it's going to get even better in the months to come great video brother keeping it real as usual thanks !\n",
      "Almost every industry is going subscription based, why wouldn't gaming? Its going to happen and at least Microsoft is at the helm and doing it right. I feel completely respected as a consumer and it seems, to me, to be healthy for gaming.\n",
      "Microsoft acquiring these studios is t just about games. It's about the new virtual metaverse Micosoft and Zuckerburg are trying to build. and having companies that already work in this industry will pay massive dividends later.\n",
      "Still can't believe sony is crying over games going to Xbox gamepass. You can't make this stuff up.\n",
      "I had to explain to ponies that Netflix isnt like Game Pass. When Netflix has a new show you can only watch it on Netflix. When Starfield is on Game Pass its not JUST on Game Pass - you can buy it digital or physical. You can play it on console, PC or streaming. They think they are comparable and when Netflix loses subscribers they try and say \"same thing will happen with game pass because they are the same\".\n",
      "Its about the cash. Tencent makes more revenue annually than both Xbox and Nintendo combined and they make zero exclusives.\n",

      "Comparing the Switch and the Series S is a good way to explain what it is. Both have a more accessible price but the difference is that Series S has a lot more power and features but cannot be used portable in a convenient way. It depends what you need/want at that price point.\n",
      "I think the implementation of FSR 2.0 and the evolution of upscaling technologies will enable the Series S to stay relevant.  The third pearly thing is a concert, but I think it’s more of a problem with games made for the previous systems ie Ace Combat 7\n",
      "I think for the price (I got mine used for 180 euros) paired with a nice 24\" 1080p IPS monitor the Series S is very good value. As you said I have found Forza, FSX and Halo to run great. To your point regarding storage space I also agree that just having space for the couple of games you are currently playing is perfect. On previous Xbox consoles I would find I'd fill up the HDD with loads of games due to Game Pass and a few other purchases and never got time to play them properly.\n",

I have been playing Halo infinite, Forza horizon 5, FiFA 22, Hades, two point campus, Ori and the wisp, & turbo golf racing. and after all these games, i still have around 143 gb left. so no complaints about storage either.

      "Let's look at this from a consumer point of view, paying developers a fee for timed exclusive is one thing. No big deal, that's just how the business is. Obviously you need a reason for customers to want to buy your console. But for Sony to intentionally go out of there way to essentially BRIBE multiple 3rd party developers to block a game ever going to gamepass and to ensure the customer continues to pay FULL price on there platform instead, because they know they can't compete with it, is about as anti consumer and monopoly driven as you can get. And they have the NERVE to call the activition deal harmful to the gaming industry???? 🤨🤨 Talk about the pot calling the kettle black 🤷🏼‍♂️🤣 Sony has no answer to gamepass, there whole business model is about making mass profits out of there customers and making them think they can't go anywhere else. This is simply Sony running scared and trying to limit the damage to the profits they are inevitably going to lose from COD. But I guarantee if Sony were big enough of a company to buy activition themselves they would have done it in a heartbeat, and you bet your bottom dollar they wouldn't leave COD multiplatform. It's apparently one rule for everyone else but completely another for Sony 🤦🤦🤦 hypocrisy at its best\n",

      "Pretty scummy on Sony's part on this one. The game wars are always fair game tactics until you do practices that deliberately sabotage the competition. MS doesn't need the console exclusivity as Game Pass is on PC as well so they just want those subsriptions.\n",
      "Sony pulling an Epic Games Store? Interesting.\n",
      "I understand if you pay for Exclusive games on your platform then it should not be on your competitor subscription service. But blocking 3rd party multi platform games is shitty.\n",
      "I didn’t even know gamepass had more potential until I learned that they are preventing it from having a lot of games ugh it used to be ridiculous to think that dvd blue ray would stop being a thing when videos went to Netflix Hulu and etc but I think that’s the future of social media anyways just my opinion\n",
      "IMO what's most interesting here is really the studios themselves and what exactly they're hoping to get out of these deals. Everyone knows that it takes at least 2 parties being in agreement to make a partnership, and most of these 3rd party studios are going to chase money. But then what I have to wonder is if Gamepass would be such a good deal for large dev studios, then why wouldn't they turn down PS? In theory, Gamepass should be attractive for devs by offering them an upfront check just to add their games while also giving them exposure to new fans who otherwise might not buy into their properties. We've also seen plenty of evidence that Xbox is swimming in Microsoft money, so they should easily have the means to outbid Sony for games they want on their service (as well as typical console exclusives for that matter). Yet, we have numerous examples of studios regularly agreeing to Sony's deals and stipulations. If a studio wanted to join GP and told Sony they would decline their GP restriction contract, I can see them getting less marketing on PS but I highly doubt Sony wouldn't want their sales. Cultural reasons and brand loyalty may be a factor for why some of these studios go with Sony, but I don't know if that would be a big enough reason for them to potentially sacrifice their bottom line. It just seems to me like somehow many studios aren't jumping at the bit to put some of their big games on Gamepass and are more comfortable getting paid to stay off it. That or GP isn't as good of a deal for various dev studios as many of us think. (No shade at GP, I love it, just saying I don't get how MS would be losing out to Sony's contracts to stay off it unless they offer too few incentives to join it in the first place)\n",
      "Its quite obvious to me that Sony fears Microsoft.  That's why they keep blocking games from going to Xbox. What the heck is wrong with a game coming out to all consoles so that everyone can play? Grow up Sony and mind your own business model and not what someone else is doing .\n",

Got it for 10$ on sale on amazon and they are i think 20 or 25 now. Worth every penny, unlike the series 2 i bought. Its a great controller as well scince they have fixed some of the reliability issues in the newer ones, however the price is still to much. If your lucky like i was you can find one refurbished for 150$ if thats a risk your willing to take buying refurbished.\n",

Thank God my internet will be fixed this week.\n",
      "to be honest, unless you have a TV that can do 4k 120hz there's no point thinking about the future \"Pro\" versions. 4k 60hz doesn't push the Series X so no point upgrading if you don't have a top of the line TV.\n",
      "I really wish they would beef up the storage on the S for it's current price. A 1tb XBOX X is the same price as an S with a 1tb expansion, makes it way less appealing. Granted you end up with a little more storage that way but also less capability in the S. Overall I feel if it wasn't for the whole world collectively crapping itself over the last couple yrs last gen would have already been put out to pasture. As it stands there's not enough current gen owners to pull that trigger yet so games have this half in half out feel. Hopefully production ramps up for PS and XBOX so we can leave last gen behind.\n",
      "I see a lot of comments from people upset about next gen games not really happening yet...we can't really blame Microsoft for that though. We have to look at the devs and ask them why they're continuing to support older hardware instead of trying to focus on the newer ones. Most likely to due with the limited availability the last couple of years but still. Now is the time they should be focusing on Series S/X\n",
      "I would say that the best thing about the XBox2 (AKA Series S/X) are the memory cards.  They're convenient & swappable.  With the size that AAA & even some AA games are coming at these days I view them as essential.  With the PS5, I'd have to get, at a bare minimum a 2 TB which ISN'T swappable.\n",
      "If we could just get support for older games to run at higher frame rates and resolutions that would be amazing.\n",
      "It's pretty ridiculous that Microsoft is looking towards upgrading systems especially with it being hard to get the new consoles now. Neither company should be focused on Pro consoles until the Series X and PS5 have been out and have reached their full potential.\n",

      "I wonder if there will be options for family plans. Like I have one sister. My parents haven't played video games since the 80s. So a two family plan I'd like, but I COULD also work with a 4 person plan. Just have me pay my share, my sister pay me hers and my best friend and his girlfriend pay me for theirs. That way everyone wins with lower priced game pass costs. I hope it's that flexible, you know?\n",
      "I feel you on the cost of the pro series controller. I have one of the series 1 pro controllers (which I bought used) and frankly I was disappointed that after I had been using it a while the rubber on the sides began to warp and peel. I had to buy third party replacement parts to swap out the little plates right there, because Xbox doesn't offer their own replacement parts, which I find kinda lame considering the rubber warping was a fairly common issue. To be honest I would prefer if they had an option to buy it with the plastic plates rather than the rubber ones cause that issue isn't going to go away after using the controller for an extended amount of time. The paddles are nice and all, but I can buy like 3 games for the cost or I can buy a third party controller from S.C.R.U.B. for less and get the same functionality out of it. But hey, to each their own. What I would really love is the ability to make a custom pro controller in their design lab. I would pay extra for that, but as it stands right now, I'll stick with my standard series X controller 🤷\n",
      "I'm beginning to lean more and more towards the opinion that the Initiative was always going to be partnering up with a bigger, more experienced studio from the get-go. Maybe they had plans to do this originally with Certain Affinity?

      "\n",
      "But it looks like Gallagher went with his old studio, Crystal Dynamics and this was the final straw that caused the schism with a number of the earlier Initiative hires. But is it really that surprising? The Initiative wasn't hiring hundreds of devs every year to scale up for a massive AAA project... they were hiring like a dozen employees per year instead. And even Jeff Grubb once succinctly put it, 'Perfect Dark was never going to be made by the Initiative'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty sure Gallagher and other high-ups knew, if they were going to make an AAA game, they were always going to need a large & experienced studio to take on most of the work-load. Trying to get that done with a 65-75 person team isn't realistic.\n",
      "If an Elite Series 3 controller is on the horizon, Microsoft really needs to focus on quality control. I went through 3 Series 2' controllers before giving up and getting a refund. I experienced faulty paddles, loose buzzing rumble motors and worst of all large deadzones on the analog sticks. I really wanted to love it but I couldn't warrant spending that kind of money on a controller with basic functionality issues.\n",
      "Family plan sounds great. Miss the old version we had on 360. Considering I've bought at least 4 consoles per generation. And 4 subscriptions monthly isn't exactly cheap. This is possibly the biggest news of this gen for myself.😁\n",
      "i have the elite series 1 controller still and it was sent into service once for the rubber loosening and a bumper not working correctly. the design and thought behind the elite series controllers is awesome, but it does require more work done to the design. esp after hearing the same rubbergripproblem happens also on series 2.\n",
      "but i also remember microsoft being at first very oppositional to the idea of the \"free to repair\" thing, but shortly after that they were called in again and microsoft had completely reversed their decision, so if a third party repairservice was able to repair anything to my series 1 controller as its been a while since i bought it, id be all in favor of it!! that would just secure the longevity of any controller basically for the foreseeable future and im glad microsoft and xbox is supporting that !\n",

Digital Foundry even said graphical differences are very miniscule, and for the most part it would take a magnifying glass to spot the differences.

Looks great on my 1440p monitor and when upscaling on 4k tv's. Gamepass is great. The hard drive is a bit small for holding s/x optimized games. I use an external for everything else. Stick to performance mode and you will not have any frame rate issues. Lastly, it fits in my backpack if I travel with it. This thing is worth every penny imo.\n",
      "More like a 5-10% performance boost, which will allow to push the console just a lil more which could make a world of difference for the series s.\n",
      "More ram being allocated to game devs is nice, but it doesn’t solve one of the biggest issues of the Series S which is the bandwidth of the memory itself. Also more ram doesn’t really mean higher frame rates, but higher quality textures or assets or increase the distance before you see LOD culling. It isn’t going to affect frame rate by going from 30 to 60, but it might allow a stuttering, inconsistent 30 FPS to hold a more locked 30 FPS.\n",
      "I hope they continue to get more put of it in the future as well. We need to finally leave last gen development behind and focus on the Series S as the base for optimization going forward. It's the perfect 1440p console and it pairs perfectly with 1440p monitors at the moment due to 1440p scaling at launch and a decent internal upscale for older content when displayed on a 1440p monitor.

      "ABOUT SFS (SAMPLER FEEDBACK STREAMING): The demo starting at the 50 second mark was configured to run in 4K and each object is a 16k x 16k BC7 texture.

I don't mind having the most popular members, but stay true to the originals. Hated when Fox screwed it all up. And Rogue WAS A VILLIAN before joining the X-men.\n",
      "Much in the way they did with Spider-Man, It does help to have Fantastic Four cast early so they can introduce them in other movies and shows. That allows them to introduce the characters and have their audience familiar with them without having to do an(other) origin story for them.\n",
      "We are just so blessed to be living in a time where there’s so much Marvel content… I’m a huge fan man! Been watching for a while now! I’m very grateful for the shows, movies & everything the MCU has brought us! Thanks for keeping us in the loop as always! You’re the 🐐\n",
      "FF needs an announcement to slowly big that hype with actors and directors for sure.  Thunderbolts is on schedule as much speculation on members and who will be the villain(s) will be.  I do like the idea of the Squadron Supreme / Sinister from another universe as mention in Mr. Roman's previous posts.\n",
      "I'm stoked for F4 casting. And while yes it's 2 years away, it was also announced in 2019, so they've had 3 years to cast it. And I'm willing to bet they had it cast before Watts left the project. And they may have them cast early so they can pop up in another film before their solo outing. It would make sense for them to show up in Quantumania.\n",
      "Sounds like a pretty solid lineup. I can't imagine them not doing the werewolf by night or guardians holiday special some what. But I guess we'll see.\n",
      "Super pumped to see who is coming in F4 full steam ahead with everything that's coming in the Thunderbolts, Kang Dynasty, Secret Wars and so much more in the MCU!!!\n",
      "This is a trailer done correctly, not spoiling anything, yet still pulling our emotions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Angela Basset is phenomenal, and her line got me right in the feels.\n",
      "This movie will be epic, definitely break every Marvel record when it drops. Love the cast, soundtrack, outfits, makeup, etc. Wakanda 4eva ! RiP Chadwick 💔💐\n",
      "I got goosebumps after listening to this trailer. This trailer is really good and full of emotions . “I am queen of the most powerful nation in the world and my entire family is gone! Have I not given everything?!” That line and the trailer as a whole sent chills down my spine. Can’t wait to see this !!!\n",
      "The fact that they included Chadwick's death in the story, and made it a core part of the drama, is a great way for the writers to connect the audience with the movie. We all grief Chadwick, and we are going to see how other people deal with this grief. Hope the move is as majestic as the music from the trailer.\n",
      "This is not just a teaser, it's a heartfelt tribute to Chadwick Boseman\n",
      "Chadwick Boseman is the reason we're where we are with this sequel! You rest in peace my friend, you are and always will be our Black Panther. Wakanda Forever! This trailer looks epic!\n",
      "This trailer is so powerful, if the trailer can bring you to tears just imagine what the movie will do. R.I.P Chadwick Boseman\n",
      "This is potentially going to be one of the greatest movies that Marvel has put forth. This trailer speaks volume and the fact that they did not reveal much is even more fantastic. Dolby AMC Opening Night!? I HAVE MY EYE ON YOU!!!\n",
      "Since day one when this trailer came out, I cannot stop watching, absolutely phenomenal.\n",
      "Honestly, i had doubts about this movie and if it should even be made. But this trailer changed my mind. It’s so powerful and this is now one of my most anticipated marvel movies. Definitely one of marvels best trailers ever. The music, the cinematography, and emotion. Incredible\n",
      "Also when it comes to She Hulk she said she can control herself when she goes full hulk. So that means she was fully aware that her kicking a group of men would have killed them.\n",
      "As a woman, I love this video. Something felt so off this phase I couldn’t put my finger on it and you explained it perfectly. Its so insulting for both sexes that what they’re doing is saying that men have to be so stupid and useless in order for women to be strong and smart.\n",
      "You just earned a new sub.  Excellent assessment and commentary! Wokeness and identity politics is killing movies.\n",
      "\"We have to stop telling men that there is no difference between competence and misogyny.\" \n",
      "Well said. Thank you!\n",
      "The thing that irks me the most is substituting good storytelling and characters for the sake of filling quotas. I love seeing diversity, it’s a wonderful thing, but it shouldn’t come at the expense of someone else or be shoehorned in for the sake of representation. Just write good stories and good characters, it’s remarkably simple.\n",
      "It’s always awesome when someone calls you sexist for not liking she hulk. The cgi looks terrible, the marvel humor is painfully unfunny, and I’m getting lectured because of my genitalia but yes, I’m not watching it simply because it has women in it. \n",
      "\n",
      "You hit the nail on the head when it comes to representation. Nobody cares about the character’s identity, people only get annoyed when the actors, directors, and studios start sucking themselves off and act like they’re MLKJ’s successor. It’s also annoying cuz they flat out refuse to market minority actors in certain countries then turn around and call you an ist for criticizing their product. \n",
      "\n",
      "Same thing with their messages. Sure there are some good messages like choosing love and don’t be racist, but they do a terrible job of conveying them. Also I don’t think a corporation that’s constantly getting accused of discriminating against race, religion, gender, ethnicity, panders to intolerant international consumers, has celebrities attack others for disagreeing with them, does business with oppressive governments, and films at concentrate camps can talk to people about love and tolerance.\n",
      "I’m a huge marvel fan… can’t wait to see each project. This was wonderfully done and beautifully narrated! I was hoping other people were feeling this too… it’s bizarre:(\n",
      "As an Asian who was actually born and brought up in Asia, I had never felt issues watching Western shows and their \"flawed\" representation. I mean if I want to watch a local movie I would just watch one from my own country, as there is no way Americans can portray my country and my people better than ourselves. This is until I am being lectured about how representation works and how happy I should be watching Americans try to act in various races that totally misrepresented them. I mean seriously, you are telling me your representation of Chinese is representing all the world's Chinese? That is patronizing as hell, because I can tell you there are so many differences between American Chinese, China Chinese and other Chinese living in different parts of the world. Crazy Rich Asians just made me cringe so hard, yes I am from Singapore.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe No Way Home would be the last good MCU movie for a long time ever, if not forever. Tried to watch Dr Strange 2, but felt like they killed the original Dr Strange and replaced him with a fake.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want a good representation movie in recent times. Try Everything Everywhere All At Once. Great representative movie, not because they checked the boxes but their background is actually part of the story, showing the struggles the characters experienced due to their background, plus the conflict between their cultural background and their current life . I mean they even represented rocks, who else can top it?\n",
      "When End Game was on the horizon, I remember being legitimately scared that the writers would make Captain Marvel kill Thanos and single handedly stop his army. So thankful they still knew how to write satisfying character arcs for the finale of my favorite franchise. The MCU ended with Endgame and everything since has just been put on the sacrificial alter of Phase 4 feminism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Spider Man NWH was just a one-off great movie for me since Tobey’s spidey was the first movie I remember seeing in theaters.\n",
      "It sucks how they’ve treated the characters we love so much with such disrespect and replaced them with toxic characters 😔 Spiderman is one of my favorite heroes in marvel and honestly, like you said, these new characters lack any character growth and as such, I don’t feel emotionally attached to them or find them even a little bit relatable or likeable. I just don’t care about these new movies or shows featuring these toxic characters. Also I just discovered your channel and I love your content 🤍\n",
      "Can we go back to the days where hulk was an angry green monster and not just my dad?\n",
      "I'm so happy to see the live action version of Princess Fiona. Disappointed they left out Shrek...but Hulk is a good compromise\n",
      "\"I'm infinitely better at controlling my anger than YOU!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bruce: Abused as a child, loses women he loves including Nat, chased by the military his entire life and forced into hiding, lives in fear of transforming and murdering innocents, actually attempts suicide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jennifer: Sometimes I get cat-called.\n",
      "My favourite part was when She-Hulk said \"don't call me she-hulk. It's Shulk\". Truly the most TV series of our time\n",
      "I miss the days were entertainment was entertaining.\n",
      "Daredevil at the end was the icing on the cake. Show looks like it’s going to be awesome.\n",
      "\"Do your thing!\"\n",
      "\"I really like this outfit!\"\n",
      "She-Hulk's clothes were fully intact. What was the purpose of that line?\n",
      "“Evil cannot create anything new, they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made”\n",
      "“I control my anger INFINITELY more than a repressed man who was abused as a child, chased by military and had his entire life, love and career ruined by an accident that produced a giant rage monster!” Well done writers!\n",
      "Finally, someone actually made the live action Shrek movie no one wanted\n",

      "Man I can’t wait for these shorts to be released especially with the most heartbreaking dialogue I’ve ever heard in my life. These writers deserve all the Oscars\n",
      "When Groot said \"It's Grootin' time\" I fell into tears, what an emotional scene with amazing script writing! Keep up the hard work!\n",
      "The scripter really touched my heart with what Groot had to say 😢 He brought a tear to my eye. The writer needs an oscar 10/10 writing\n",
      "The only words I can use to describe how I am feeling right now are “I am groot.”\n",
      "When Groot said \"It's Grootin' time\" I fell into tears, what an emotional scene with amazing script writing! Keep up the hard work!\n",

      "There are not NEARLY enough episodes in this series - Groot deserves more!\n",
      "Sin previo aviso nos lanzan un tráiler de Ms Marvel de golpe , espero que esta serie sea muy disfrutable, se ve muy prometedor y me gustó mucho el soundtrack del trailer\n",
      "Marvel siempre poniendo la música indicada para sus trailers, que siempre terminan agradando mucho\n",
      "Soy fanático de Marvel y de The Weeknd, ¡este tráiler fue un puro regalo! ¡¡No puedo esperar a la serie!!\n",
      "Esta serie probablemente no sea para todos, ¡pero está bien! Me gusta cómo Marvel está ampliando sus producciones en estilos y tonos para llegar a más cantidad de público.\n",
      "Me sentí en los 2000's viendo una serie de Disney Chanel.. 🥺❤️\n",
      "Un trailer SIEMPRE tiene que intentar verse épico para llamar la atención y que la serie prometa ser vista por muchos.\n",
      "Pero muchas veces el trailer resulta mejor que toda la serie y no termina siendo lo que uno esperaba.\n",
      "Por lo que se ve en el trailer, va a ser una serie con 90% probelmas de una chica adolescente como por ejemplo problemas amorosos y 10% de cosas de súperhéroes.\n",
      "Ojalá no sea así.\n",
      "Amo que Marvel siempre en sus tráiler usan una buena música\n",
      "Me atraparon de inmediato al poner \"Blinding Lights\" y poder ver un adelanto de como Kamala usando sus poderes se vio genial por los colores y efectos, le tengo mucha fe a esta serie, apúnteme para el estreno!\n",
      "El tráiler de una épica serie, se merecía una épica canción como Blinding Lights... espero que éste temazo se escuche en algún episodio ❤️\n",
      "Me gusta que se ve muy colorido ya que antes de esta serie se viene Moon knight que es un personaje más oscura (también por las diferentes edades y etapas xd) y así después que viene está toda colorida me gusta el contraste de diferentes personajes con personalidades claramente diferentes y creo que las 2 van a ser muy épicas\n",

      "I never thought that this movie will be made without Chadwick Boseman & and it still feels incomplete.\n",

      "I love that the hero’s got the “hero track” and the villains get Master of Puppets, especially when that riff kicks in is just so much fun\n",
      "This trailer proves there are still directors and writers out there who understand quality and hold themselves to a high standard.  This trailer was awesome!  This is one of the best pieces of footage that I have seen from Marvel in a while.\n",
      "LOOK SO AWESOME! 10/10!\n",
      "This game is definitely giving me Marvel Nemesis vibes and I’m all for it!!!\n",
      "If they made an entire movie out of this type of quality, I would pay to go see it in theaters.\n",
      "I respect everyone who were involved in this. Seriously the best piece that I've ever seen on YouTube. HATS OFF TO WELL ALL! LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!\n",
      "After seeing good ol' Spidey in this trailer, now I want the game even more.\n",
      "Wow they actually got Yuri Lowenthal to voice Peter in this one too. That was actually very unexpected.\n",
      "This is awesome, the new design that Marvel give to the armor of Iron man is so cool, the black color is perfect in his armor, also the design of venom is great, and we have ghost rider, i love it. This is a game of marvel that have my attention already.\n",
      "Mano não vou falar dela, mas o que fizeram com o Hulk, é uma das coisas mais tristes que já aconteceu na face da Terra😥.\n",

      "Daqui a pouco eles vão anunciar um show de stand up de Thor e Hulk, os novos comediantes da Marvel\n",
      "Quando Thanos enfrentou o Hulk em guerra infinita eu achei um absurdo total como que um personagem que é movido pelo ódio e o ódio é o sua fonte de força foi dominado e jogado ao chão sendo que até o capitão América teve uma performance maior perante o Thanos, agora vendo esse trailer e entendi, a Marvel transformou o incrível Hulk em um comédia Hulk, que lástima tudo isso.\n",
      "Segue a desconstrução dos maiores e melhores heróis da Marvel\n",
      "As vezes fico pensando... \"era melhor o thanos ter ganho\" .\n",

      "Crazy how Daredevil is getting the same hype as Secret Wars! Shows how much the fans love him.\n",
      "Unbelievable! As a comic book fan I still cannot believe how far Marvel has come along. Thank you Marvel and Disney.\n",
      "These announcements are bigger than the “Infinity Saga” as a whole. Secret Wars is the singular BIGGEST event in comics. And with this Kang storyline being set up, these next two phases will easily be the best yet. I am incredibly excited to behold what the “Multiverse Saga” will bring.\n",
      "I'm one of those fans that get excited when watching any Marvel movie or series. I love what Disney and Marvel Studios have created. I can't wait to watch all of these\n",
      "I feel so lucky to be here to witness the birth of not only a new phase but a new saga too. I got into Marvel during Phase 4 and missed out on all of the Infinity Saga hype and seeing all of this for Phase 5 makes me feel so, so, happy, especially with all the joy Marvel has bought me currently. I am literally so ready to witness these movies and shows with others and cannot wait to see what comes in the MCU!\n",
      "Imagine future generations binging all MCU movies and TV shows from start to finish 😂\n",
      "I have to say that I couldn't be more pleased to hear the daredevil is going to get a long episodic run. 18 episodes is literally awesome. That is probably my favorite news out of this whole slate release\n",
      "Never in my life did I think I'd see an announcement of a Secret Wars adaptation. Really eager to see the best comic book storyline of all time getting a live action adaptation. 🔥🔥\n",
      "The fact they’ve given Daredevil 18 episodes is amazing.\n",
      "I hope they have the writing team from Netflix return.\n",
      "Hell yeah! Let the multiverse saga begin and I can’t wait to see daredevil, the fantastic four and all new heroes and villains in the MCU it’s gonna be marvelous\n",

As the figure gets closer, it takes on a less and less abstract shape until we see it is in fact Nick Fury, looking pretty grizzled after his time in space. Maria Hill meets with Fury at a bar. She tells him that she’s been unsuccessfully trying to reach him for years. Maria asks why after all this time he decided to come back. “This is different,” he says. \n",

He explains that he is still on call if the Avengers need him, but that his main priority in life is taking care of his daughter, Cassie. As he finishes the chapter and the crowd applauds, Scott’s phone rings, and the caller ID tells him that it’s the SFPD, leading him to remark aloud, “Why is jail calling?”\n",

Scott explains that he knows she is just trying to help, and when Cassie says that she is trying to “do something that matters,” her dad reminds her that he “literally saved the world.” This comment receives fake shock from everyone else, who sarcastically note that he has never mentioned that fact before, and Janet tells him that he should write a book about it.

As it powers up, it emits a bright blue light that sends out an energy wave, and Cassie gets sucked inside of it. As Scott Lang panics and tries to grab her, he too is pulled inside the light along with the rest of the main cast, landing them in the Quantum Realm. \n",

      "No its not an A or even a B rate movie.....the core cpl went from being a no nothing not worried about nothing , to analyzing what was going on around the world AT THAT TIME  and starting on a journey that i think many of us have been on for awhile. I will not criticize their reactions , too many people right now are right where they were at the start of this movie. Instead , they started to oopen their eyes and see what possibilitys could happen and took the first steps into prepardness. Im as bad as they are about knowing my neighbers , ill admit that , ive lived in this house 25 years and i only know and talk to 2 of my neighbers...and theres like 20 familys up here withen a mile mabey more.

      "You hit a soft spot with Ronin.  I think that movie is a masterpiece that went largely unnoticed.  The acting, the dense sub-text, the camera angles, the story progresses while revealing nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Awesome\n",
      "Penelope is actually a really great movie. My roommate and I love this movie and have watched it many many times. If you haven't seen it you should and I have to say it's a great movie for school age kids to watch because it will teach them a lot of lessons against bullying others, or if you're child is the one being bullied then they will learn a lot about how to love themselves no matter what they look like. And for those parents who criticize your children a lot you can learn a lot about accepting your child for who they are regardless of how you had envisioned your child to be. There's a lot to learn from people of all ages. Watch it!!\n",
      "Great recommendations list, Darren. Ronin and the car chases, awesome and has a great plot. Silence Of The Lambs; just a superb horror. Agree that Anthony Hopkins is on his finest day, with his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter. Just received my latest Universal Yums, from Czech Republic, today 9/23/2021!!! Many thanks for sharing with us and catch you on your next presentation. Take care ⭐️⭐️⭐️\n",
      "These movie reviews are always good, and largely because they are honest. If a given film is admittedly not the greatest or otherwise flawed,  the reviewer still tries  to point out what might be good or desirable about the movie etc. It's a very democratic approach. Always a good job !\n",
      "I recently watched \"Hackers\" again and realized that it's a really good pairing with the original \"Tron\". They both present ridiculous representations of how computers work but they are complementary, just from opposite sides of the screen. Great performances from a great cast in both cases. They are solid presentations of how people wished computers worked in the late twentieth century immediately before and after Al Gore opened up the internet to everyone.\n",
      "One thing that makes or breaks a film is how the filmmaker respects the source material, in this case being The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris. The film respected and captured this incredible book, & the casting of Jodi Foster and Anthony Hopkins, with Jonathan Demme directing, made it a masterpiece. Some movies you sit and watch.  Others creat a dimensional world you enter completely and that never really leaves you.\n",
      "While I generally agree with your comments about Ronin, the callous disregard of collateral damage - shooting into crowds and causing violent vehicle accidents - was a total turn-off for me. They spread injury and death among innocent bystanders without any sign of care or compassion.\n",
      "I just watched Post Mortem on Netflix last night and really liked it.  It's from Norway and has only six episodes in the series.  I'm not sure how I could describe it - horror? (a little); comedy? (a bit); police procedural?  (I guess...some).  It was just really strange and (at least to me), very entertaining.  Also, I watch all foreign movies with sub-titles so I don't know if it's dubbed or not.  Anyway, check it out!\n",
      "I'm sure you've seen Malevolent from 2018 with Florence Pogue, but if you haven't it's just a really well acted horror flick.  I seem to like just about everything Florence Pogue is in.  Thanks for another great list as I plan to check out Primer and Troll 2, both of which I never would have considered without your recommendation.  Pls keep making as many of these lists as you can!!\n",
      "The Revelation behind this movie is so divine. A great Applause for the Production of this movie.\n",
      "movie title is \"THE BLACK RIDER:  REVELATION\".  It is an \"After civilization falls survival film\" of fairly good quality.\n",
      "Wow!!! I loved this! Can't wait for the next one!!!\n",
      "Woo...!,this movie is inspirational most especially the last part where the little girl died I really love that part and there's a great lesson there.\n",
      "Big thanks to the writer and all who put work to make this movie a success🙏😍💖💥\n",
      "This is not Black Adam. This is Black Rider. Totally different movie with totally different actors in a totally different timeframe. Black Rider is a good(ish) movie, though.\n",
      "This is the movie you get when you combine Mad Max, The Postman, Book of Eli, and a low budget.\n",

      "Who's your favorite character on The Bear, chef?\n",
      "I know that you have other things going on, but I seriously miss the regularity of your videos during the height of the pandemic. You, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, Marion's Kitchen, Nicki Positano, and a few others are what got me through the days (weeks!) of quarantining alone and food shortages. The fridge in your old kitchen gave me hope that I  could shop and cook for good food and make it work in my ancient undersized fridge. At the same time, I was unemployed just before the pandemic. I'm now employed again (yay!), but I miss the regularity/frequency of my favorite YouTube channels. Best wishes!\n",
      "I can’t tell you enough how excited I get every time you release a new video. I’m actually making your infamous stew today ….and probably this chicken Piccata recipe tomorrow 😋\n",
      "The video was only posted 5 hours ago and I already got off work, went to the grocery store, made it, and am eating it as we speak. And unsurprisingly ITS GOOD!\n",
      "I've been in the mood for chicken piccata for a while so this has just solidified my grocery run for this evening.\n",
      "What I like about no breading or flour is it's less bits left in the pan to possibly burn --- I could make a nice sangwich with this and the sauce as a dip. \n",

      "The editing is topnotch!! Oh, and the food looks incredible too!\n",
      "Alison!!! 💖🥰 I absolutely love watching your videos. This looks delicious! Definitely a recipe I’ve gotta try. I was looking for a really good chicken piccata recipe and here we are! 😁\n",
      "I love you, Alison! Can’t wait to make this, this week and I hope it’s okay to call you this, but you are truly my favorite chef!!!!💖💖💖\n",
      "Thank you so much Alison for sharing with us another of your wonderful recipes, even if they are as classic as a chicken piccata, I really appreciate the personal twists that you give to them! Your twists bring the dishes to a next level!  \n",
      "\n",
      "I am very sorry for the abuses (micro-aggressions) that you had to endure in your profession. I had no idea what the word \"Chef\", said it in that context, meant. But I know, from my own experience, how even simple words/statements can actually be aggressions towards other people. I have felt that many times in my profession too (which has nothing to do with cooking, btw!).\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucky us that despite those unfortunate abuses, they did not make you dislike cooking and quit altogether. On the contrary, you persevered in your chosen path and now you are sharing your uniqueness and talent with us. Thanks again.\n",

      "wow I'm so proud of lil mama. She did a great job playing this role. It really captures what goes on every day in the hood. I cried, laughed, and my heart was touched. I know so many ppl with similar situations and I am thankful someone is bringing it to light.\n",
      "This movie really taught me more than I already have known, I'm a young girl trying to start a new life alone after all the trauma I strongly believe that all shall come to end....

      "Lil Mama is so slept on. She is full of talent.\n",

      "OMG LIL MOMMA is SOOOOOO TALENTED AND GORGEOUS ...I hope her acting career takes off she is one of the greatest and they don’t show her enough love this is pure talent and this movie is bomb asf\n",
      "This movie has powerful messages in it. This my first time watching it. Lil mama is a really good actress and rest in peace Traci Braxton\n",
      "Wow this movie was raw...the fact that she lied to majority of the people she spoke to about her kids because she was ashamed says volumes. This was wayyyyy too good for free on YouTube but I'm glad it was.\n",
      "This little girl brought tears to my eyes. She’s so smart. Lil MaMa is the truth all around !\n",
      "So sad I cried 😭😭 she looks just like my daughter I would never take her through the bullshit I went through 🙏 I love this movie\n",
      "Great movie!! I cried at the end. Praying for all the young girls who may be going through something like this!! Keep your head up! Better days are coming 🙏🏾🙏🏾\n",

      "The film is set in Jennings County, Indiana, in 1862. Jess Birdwell (Gary Cooper) is a farmer and patriarch of the Birdwell family whose Quaker religion conflicts with his love for the worldly enjoyments of music and horse racing. Jess's wife Eliza, (Dorothy McGuire) a Quaker minister, is deeply religious and steadfast in her refusal to engage in violence. Jess's daughter Mattie (Phyllis Love) wants to remain a Quaker but has fallen in love with dashing cavalry officer Gard Jordan (Peter Mark Richman), a love that is against her mother's wishes. Jess's youngest child \"Little\" Jess (Richard Eyer) is a feisty child whose comical feud with his mother's pet goose causes her heartache. Jess's elder son Josh (Anthony Perkins) is torn between his hatred of violence and a conviction that to protect his family he must join the home guard and fight the invaders. Enoch (Joel Fluellen), a runaway slave, is a laborer on their farm; his children are still enslaved in the South.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are introduced to the family via its youngest member, \"Little\" Jess, who is forever at war with his mother's pet goose. The story begins as an easygoing and humorous tale of Quakers trying to maintain their faith as they go to meeting on First Day (Sunday); contrasted with the Birdwells' neighbor Sam Jordan (Robert Middleton) and other members of the nearby Methodist Church. The mood shifts dramatically when the meeting is interrupted by a Union officer who asks how the Quaker men can stand by when their houses will be looted and their families terrorized by approaching Confederate troops. When confronted with the question of his being afraid to fight, Josh Birdwell responds that it might be the case. His honesty provokes the wrath of Purdy, a Quaker elder who condemns people who don't believe as he does.\n",
      "\n",
      "The film returns to its lighter tone as the Quakers try to maintain their ways, despite the temptations of amusements at a county fair, and a new organ (which Jess buys over Eliza's opposition), but one is always reminded that the Confederate Army is drawing closer. On a business trip, Jess acquires a new horse from the widow Hudspeth (Marjorie Main), and is finally able to defeat Sam in their weekly horse race. One day, Jess is cultivating his fields and notices an immense cloud of smoke on the horizon produced by the burning of buildings. Josh soon arrives and tells them the neighboring community has been reduced to ash and corpses. Josh believes that he must fight, a conviction that threatens to destroy the family. Eliza tells him that by turning his back to their religion he's turning his back on her, but Jess sees things a different way. Josh finds himself on the front line of the battle to stop the advance of the raiders, and only fires his gun when the man next to him is wounded. Meanwhile, Jess is reluctant to fight, only picking up a rifle and riding off towards the fighting when the family horse gallops back to the farm riderless.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Confederates arrive at the farm, with only Eliza and the younger children present, the family and the farm are saved when Eliza greets them on the porch and welcomes them to take all the food and animals they want and feeds them in their kitchen. As Jess finds Sam Jordan dying he is bushwhacked by a \"Reb\". He plays possum and when the Confederate soldier approaches he struggles with him and takes away his gun, but ultimately lets him go free and unhurt. He then finds Josh injured and brings him home. Each member of the family faces the question of whether it is ever right to engage in violence.\n",

Timeless is correct.\n",
      "I saw this movie in seventies as a teenager several times. They were all so larger than life heroes. There can never be another Magnificent Seven.\n",
      "Even though the movie is a remake, it's one of all time greats. Sure, some plot twists are naive, and the fighting/effects don't stand to contemporary cinematography, but everything else is simply brilliant, starting with the original score, all the way to the moral lessons the movie brings. A true inspiring masterpiece.\n",
      "I first watched this movie in a cinema in 1960s . The righteousness, truthfulness, bravery and courage shown in the characters in the movie helped to mold my character in the later days of my youth and made me join the uniformed service to serve the public.\n",
      "Esta película es excelente, fue filmada en México (Cuernavaca, Durango, Tepoztlán y los estudios Churubusco de la ciudad de México), además de contar con extraordinarios actores estadounidenses (Yul Brynner, Charles Bronson, Steve McQueen o James Coburn), también  contó con magníficos actores mexicanos (Jorge Martínez de Hoyos, Enrique Lucero o Rosenda Monteros)\n",

      "I completely agree with you about Thirteen Lives! I watched it the other night and I wasn't sure I was going to make it to the end. It was so intense and I felt so claustrophobic and almost panicky at times watching it. Unbelievably fantastic movie!\n",
      "Better Luck Tomorrow is still one of my all time favorite films. As an Asian-American, I never understood the criticism that this film made us look bad. That viewpoint was actually way worse and even racist, in my opinion. What, we can only have roles as nerds, straight A students, martial artists, dutiful sons and daughters, etc? This film portrayed more of my reality at that age than any other film ever did. Sure, I wasn't dealing and stealing and whatnot. I was in all advanced classes and band. But I also ran track and played volleyball and had a cheerleader girlfriend and went to parties. I felt seen by this film. I may not have always agreed with Ebert but I will always respect him for using his influence and voice in the industry to shoot down that nonsense at the time.\n",
      "I wish someone would come up with a streaming service that includes a lot of movies from the 40s and 50s without having to pay extra for them. I'm a big fan of classics including the likes of Cary Grant, Kate Hepburn, William Powell, etc. I used to be able to watch them on YouTube, but they've pretty much all been pulled because of copyright infringement.\n",
      "Thirteen Lives was incredible. It's exactly how we as human should be behaving.\n",
      "I really liked Bound! It shows even if you have a small budget you can still make a really good movie. 13 Lives was good also. I watched Marathon Man when I was too young to get into it or understand it, I recently watched it on Prime.\n",
      "You could not have been more spot on with Thirteen Lives Darren. What an amazing film! Incredible. Thank you as always for the recommendations.\n",
      "I always appreciate the work you put into your reviews. I feel that you’re very thorough and honest in your opinion. Thank you for what you do. JCVD is an amazing movie. Very hidden gem.\n",
      "Another killer list! I've said it before, but check out Birdy for one of Nicolas Cage's earliest movies, and 'Hector and the Search for Happiness'. Both are terrific movies.\n",
      "13 lives was an excellent movie! I remember hearing the situation on the news. I didn't realize how long those kids were trapped and what had to be done to get them out. \n",
      "Drowning/ suffocating is a fear of mine so seeing this had me on the edge of my seat anxious as fuck but it was worth it.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND  this movie.  It was so so good.  Great even.👍👍👍👍👍\n",
      "I have watched Vikram vedha on youtube in Hindi last year. I don't think, Saif can beat R. Madhwan in acting. R Madhwan surprised us in the end as he looks innocent throughout the whole movie. But Saif doesn't look innocent at all throughout the trailer. R Madhwan's smile was enough to make Vikram vedha a thriller movie.\n",
      "Vijay sethupathi is one of the most talented actor I have seen in south industry n r Madhavan is one of the most underrated actor love the original masterpiece❤️\n",
      "Krk reviews should be released in theatres all reviews one after another for 3 hours it will become blockbuster 😂\n",
      "Sad to see that in the name of entertainment we are spending so much on Theater tickets that these actors are demanding 25+ Crores for a movie. Even highly educated Proffesionals (CA's, Engineers, Doctors, Civil Servants etc) do not earn this kind of money in India after 10 year of service. \n",
      "\n",
      "A simple logic, if theses actors (Including the Kumars, Khan's, Devgans, Kapoor's, Roshans, etc) start charging 10 to 50 lac per movie,  the theater ticket price will drop automatically and eventually we can start enjoying movie in the theaters with our families at a much lesser price.\n",
      "\n",
      "These Superstars have built their mansions worth 100+ Crores and secured the life's of their children and grandchildren. They are living king-size life with our hard earned money. I believe we better stick to OTT or any other form of free entertainment which is easily available on YouTube or any other app\n",

      "Hey KRK , you are someone who is an well educated well sensed human who is trying to destroy the good works for his own personal interest. Everyone can agree that the recent Vikram Vedha teaser is really well stucked piece of art. Yeah it's a remake but why it has made ? Because the original one was not popular at all and it holds a great contents so why not it should be showcased second time . Hrithik Roshan is someone who thrives himself towards great art work . So guys don't take seriously these kind of nonsense review by a nonsense person like KRK ✌️✍️\n",
      "3:13 hilarious review 😅🤣😂😅\n",
      "I am Pakistani and I always wait for KRK videos, by God big fan KRK bro\n",
      "I watch your videos everyday because you always made my day with your incredible review, also I'd say KRK's viewer doing unfair with him because he deserves like similar to views, everyone must like his videos because he is doing hard working for us and he always keep us updated about bollywood activities and news, so he deserves for views, like and followers.\n",

It's worth the watch. Get your hearts warmed and the tissues out. Smiles! Ruth was deserving of all her flowers.

      "Grandes atores que já se foram. Mesmo num enredo simples e quase cômico, eles , com suas firmes atuações, transmitiram  impacto e emoção em seus desempenhos. Kirk Douglas ( nesse filme ele já estava bem idoso ) viveu mais de 100 anos. Morreu de velhice.  James Coburn deixou-se engordar com mais idade, engordou demais e morreu de ataque cardíaco. James foi grande amigo e aluno do inesquecível Bruce Lee.\n",

      "The main problem with the tiger scene in fury is that decision making. Although independent thinking was encouraged in the German army, the choice here to take the tiger out of cover and engage on the move is a miserable decision on the commanders behalf. The tiger had no gyroscopic turret so would be very inaccurate whilst moving. He also has the ability to kill all of those Shermans through their front armour at that range and can’t even be sure they know his exact position. Essentially, the commander is a tool.\n",
      "In fury it infuriated me that the German tank decided to blow his cover and close the distance with the Shermans. The tiger had an amazing advantage but blew it all away\n",
      "I love how accurate his interpretation of Batman's Tumbler was. He says it would only protect from small caliber rounds and something like a rocket propelled grenade would do serious damage.

      "Balto is a legend. His statue in Central Park proves it. He raced the entire length of the last two stops on the modern ididorod without help to get medication for a pandemic that hit Alaska. He ran in a blizzard for 8 hours without rest just to give kids children a chance to survive. A true legend.\n",

      "Great video! As an established data scientist myself, this is definitely an accurate data science project lifecycle; however, I almost never go through all of these steps in the same day. You can spend whole days just cleaning data, tuning models, or putting things into production. The work that you do can also vary by company, some data scientists only work on part of that lifecycle just doing exploration and modeling or modeling and productionization. I have a few videos on my channel that complement this one nicely for those interested!\n",
      "it was a great overview of all the process.  it would be great if we get more videos on DATA PREPARATION, EDA. various methods\n",
      "for different scenarios.\n",
      "Great video. You did great explaining this. That said, I would argue that it can never be overstated how extremely rigorous you must be in the earliest steps. Specifically data acquisition and cleaning. Mistakes in these steps will often corrupt every subsequent step in your research. Furthermore, it is these earliest steps that are the hardest if not impossible to correct if mistakes are found. Do some field work, say NSF or an FFRDC gives you 2 million dollars for it. Go out into the field and unknowingly bring the wrong brand of batteries for your solar panels that you don’t figure out until your back? Oh well. This seemingly tiny and innocent mistake turns a long lived project of monitoring an area into a very short lived one when the battery dies. All the clocks on your instruments are not correctly synced by gps and you have timing errors now? Now we have absolutely horrible data that needs to be cleaned! THE FIRST TWO STEPS (ACQUISITION AND CLEANING) ARE SO IMPORTANT!!!!!\n",
      "Thank you for this super interesting video! :)\n",
      "I would like to ask you something: Which are the most important skills that a data analyst should have/learn?\n",

      "Now I'm much interested to become Data Scientist.\n",
      "Data science explained in such a clean and brilliant manner!! Thank you for the awesome video!!\n",
      "This is really a very clear presentation of what really goes with a data science project from the very beginning. However, things do not happen very easily. There are a lot of challenges that you have to deal with. In data cleaning alone, the time that you use can be overwhelming.\n",
      "Your videos are what is getting me the necessary introduction to data science. Thank you so much!\n",

But for now I can say that my inclination is more on the side of Data cleaning, Data modelling and Data visualisation. I might probably end up somewhere close to being a Data Analyst, Can't imagine beyond that for now. Checked for all points that you mentioned. Bang on. Except for the last one - Marketing one's own work. I am someone who believes strongly in my work speaking for myself rather than otherwise. Have been trying hard to change this mindset of mine. Might take a while but will get to it definitely. Thanks for this informative one. Helped me clear my mind about certain things. See you on the next livestream.\n",

      "This was really insightful and helpful, thanks for making this!\n",
      "I’m currently an entry level Community Manager. Data Science is so intriguing to me as it would allow me to listen to userbases and other communities so much more closely. You just gave me what I need to get started learning! Thank you!\n",
      "I found this video to be very well done!! When I begin work on a new model, I always start with a Google search, and go from there. Unfortunately, you can't do this during an interview. I feel like some of the best people on planet earth get overlooked, all the time, just because employers expect people to start with a blank piece of paper, and build out a model. I've been in the data science world for the past 10 years, and that's 10 years of proven success. If that's not good enough for you, writing code on a blank sheet of paper won't help very much at all.\n",
      "This is very helpful, thanks for putting this together :)\n",
      "The biggest problem I’ve had so far is working with my manager. We both have very different perspectives on various problems but he simply doesn’t even want to hear my perspective even when my perspective is usually right. We are both data scientists but he graduated as a data scientist back in 2003. So he’s an old head and I recently graduated. It’s very tough to get along and having your voice heard\n",
      "I'm learning Data Science and whenever I read job descriptions for entry levels or even for Interns they want you to be jack of all trades and on top of that require you to have 2,3 years of experience. Plus they include big data streamlines and ask you to be an expert on it too along with all sorts of cloud services. I mean it feels like they're demanding an Intermediate Data Scientist and terming it as \"Data Analysis Intern\" or \"Junior Data Analyst\" role. This frustrates me a lot.\n",
      "Yes there’s ambiguity in role definitions. In my previous company, I worked as Data scientist. However I hardly did any data science work. It was more like a developer work where I was assigned to test and deploy the ML models in production. I could learn a lot about aws cloud architecture and services. Trouble shoot real time issues. But did little of ML. Then I changed my job and joined as Data analyst. Here I do little of analysis, SQL etc and more of ML like developing models and fine tuning them. Cleaning the data, feature engineering and feature selection. \n",
      "I would caution the people aspiring to enter the field because many a times companies themselves are not sure where and how they are going to use data science, what are the prerequisites for a successful data science project. They lack quality data, if they do have data- accessing and compiling the data is another issue. After aligning with multiple departments as single man army, you are expected to give some magical results. When results are satisfactory, you will be asked to deploy them. Here again the streamlined organisational requirements are missing. Somehow you drag the project. Later you are expected to monitor and troubleshoot issues in production. And then after all of this single man army efforts, management doesn’t see any value in it. Just to keep up with trend companies end up hiring a data scientist and expect that person to assume multiple roles and give them an end to end solution. They are just giving analytics a try without investing much in it.\n",
      "I feel like tech jobs always morph: we have hiring expansions and more specialities, then we have layoffs and more generalizations. It does seem like the demand for data scientists dropped off a cliff, but I’ve been studying it a bit as a way to complement other skills. Thanks for the video ☺️\n",
      "Great insight! I got into data science right after college and really struggled to do so. The fact that the data science job role is defined so differently at different companies made interviews really hard to prep for. It felt like you need to be a jack of all trades and be well versed in data science, data engineering and data analyst principles and it was just a lot to prep for. Plus a lot of roles require graduate degrees. After I got a role, I left after a year and transitioned into SWE as like you said the expectations didn’t match the reality plus I was also at a toxic workplace. I realized that I want to be in a role that is more well-defined and somewhat uniform across companies so if i need to look for a job later, I’m not being restricted to only a subset of opportunities bc of the different definitions and requirements.\n",
      "thanks for sharing your experiences! The manager who spoke of wanted applied scientists (a category I wasn't aware of before this video) was odd to me. So he was saying that there wasn't enough data science related work for a full time hire (or else he wouldn't be wanting someone who could also serve as a software engineer). I can imagine companies having this need (smaller companies in particular where individuals have to wear multiple hats), but if I were a data scientist trying to get hired as a data scientist, I'd avoid this manager/company! I actually left a job in the 90s for this reason--I was being pulled into other jobs/tasks that weren't related to machine learning, so I left and joined a company I could do machine learning full time (I'm an old guy!  I predated data science, so in that time, it was called \"data mining\" or \"pattern recognition\". and yes, I'm using machine learning and data science interchangeably even though I know they aren't fully interchangeable). \n",
      "\n",
      "The manager is key--even if you like the company, if you don't respect or are respected by your manager, it will be an awful job. Remember that when you are being interviewed, you are also interviewing them! :)\n",
      "You covered some really great points that I'm also experiencing in my current role as a \"data scientist\". Tbh I don't even know what I'm supposed to be doing and it makes me feel so lost especially since I'm still early in my career. I saw 2 great people leave the team to work as a data engineer and a software engineer. It's absolutely demotivating to see people leave. I'm also looking into transitioning into a more data engineer and/or product analytics role but the interview prep is super overwhelming/difficult and imposter syndrome really kicks in. 😢\n",
      "Its really difficult to work as a Data scientist because every company have different expections from Data Scientist. And now a days, a data scientist should know all the skills like computer vision, deep learning, Operational research, Machine learning, SQL and many more. There must a  discrete line between data scientist work roles. And also as you have mentioned interview prep, it is really difficult because we need to prep from scratch. — Struggle of a DataScientist\n",
      "Preparing for interviews can be arduous because like you pointed out that different organisations have different definitions of a Data Scientist role and Data Science is such an extremely broad term that is often times disputed amongst people. You only find out when you sit for the interviews that the organisations sometimes are actually looking for a Data Analyst or ML Engineer or Data Engineer when the interview doesn't circle around what you'd imagine it to be. But that's the reality and thanks for pointing it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "And most of the time I am just scraping and cleaning the data which definitely gives me mixed feelings about my job role. I could really relate to your experiences and it definitely resonated with me. Such an insightful video for the ones who want to pursue their career in Data Science because often times it can be misinterpreted.\n",
      "In my personal experience the harsh reality also included:\n",
      "1. Studying all the time, to the point that you personal life gets affected.  8 hours of work and 4 hours a day  of just keep up with the new lake, cloud , software, technique, library , bi tool etc. \n",
      "2. The feeling of \"You don't know enough\", \"You are not enough\". You briefly mention this and I am glad that  I am not the only feeling the same way. I know python enough to do my job, but I am not a python expert who can write functions from scratch, or change between languages say from python to  java or R. I use the existing libraries and move on to the next project.\n",

      "Great video Shane! Completely Nailed it. As a data scientist myself, I was a little surprised at how high the job satisfaction scores were.  On the job, a lot of my peers find that they aren't challenged enough by their positions. This is probably because data science is still relatively new, and companies are still figuring out how to create value with data teams. The other side of that is that once you have a data science role it is pretty easy to land another data science job so qualified data scientists can just leave if they aren't liking the position at hand. I love seeing the data and trying to map it to what I'm hearing anecdotally!\n",
      "I loved the remark about how if/when data scientists' jobs get automated, either the world would have ended, or world peace would have been achieved. 🤣\n",
      "Excellent, data-driven assessment of this field.  I am 57 with a BS in math just retired (not really, want to work in data science) and pursuing a masters in statistics.  I have one class in machine learning where neither the professor nor students are over thirty. Most of the students are early twenties and some might still be in their teens.  I was able to start on Zoom but now that we are back in the class my status is very clear although I keep fit and positive (I never lied about my age - that would be creepy but didn't need to advertise it either so long as I pulled my weight in study groups).  I feel so out of place but just shake it off and try to keep on moving forward as best I can.  You mentioned ageism and while I have not attempted to apply for any jobs yet I have experienced ageism and how one's \"value\" can diminish at a job.  The brutality of it can be very harsh on the receiving end and wonder why people do not realize they will be there sooner than they might care and wonder if they consider the world they are creating.  Me, I'll keep on going until I cannot.  I enjoy turning data into knowledge.  I am sure your analytics show your main demographic are on the younger end but wonder if you will address ageism in later videos.  Either way, keep the data and its interpretation flowing and \"Rage, rage against the dying of the light!\"\n",

      "Thanks for the great content Shane. As a data scientist myself, who came into this field via the shortcut route essentially, given that my own engineering field had few jobs available, one thing I have noticed is that it is often more useful to a data scientist and their company if the data scientist comes from the shortcut route. If you come in with the domain knowledge of one engineering discipline or some other discipline, plus the skills you need as a data scientist, you can carve for yourself much more important roles within an organization and offer insights that traditional data science program graduates cannot. While traditional education pathways into data science offers a clear cut set of classes to take, it rarely allows us to draw the connection to real world data science in depth. You end up being able to do what the shortcut data scientists can do, but without the specialized domain knowledge. Coming from an engineering discipline myself, I was able to understand data science problems with product perspective and help deliver projects in novel ways. I have noticed the same with my other peers who also don't come from the traditional route. I say this because I have met with a lot of non-traditional route students who want to do data science but feel a little scared or worried that they can't break through. They definitely can break through and thrive in this field. They offer specialized insights you can't get through the traditional route. So if you are someone who is studying even something in the humanities, like linguistics or english, you can become a powerful data scientist (with perhaps a specialization related to what you studied, such as NLP). If you are someone who comes from a STEM field, even better, because you will already likely have most of the mathematical foundations needed to approach most data science problems. All data scientists are expected to be able to do the basics of data science. But what sets apart good data scientists from great data scientists is the ability to properly contextualize a business problem, address user needs, and help in the development of a product in a way that is meaningful beyond just a typical model. I don't mean to say students who do the traditional route are by any means necessarily worse off, but I do think they should also invest in acquiring knowledge in some other domains as well.\n",
      "My close friend got his bachelors in Electrical Engineering then went for his Masters in Data Science. He is now making $245k including bonuses at Intuit as a Machine Learning Engineer and he’s only 26 with no experience. Got the interview thanks to his Masters then barely passed the interview by doing over 200 leetcode questions 3x each.\n",
      "Great video. I'm a data analyst and just accepted an offer for data scientist position, so I have some ideas on the markets for both jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion, the window for people with no previous data experience and no degree in an analytical subject getting a job as a data scientist has almost completely closed. Those folks oftentimes won't even get past the HR screener.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's so many new data science and analytics Master's programs that have opened up, along with the wide variety of analytical degrees that are acceptable (statistics, computer science, economics, physics, etc) that someone without an analytical degree and without any job experience as a data analyst or other data professional is just never going to get an interview. Even if you have a great portfolio, the HR screen is not even going to look at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if you have experience as a data analyst and pick up one of these new data science or analytics master's degrees the job market becomes super easy.\n",
      "Hi Shane, the actuary here who has commented on your channel frequently.  I would just like to point out that actuary is a special case of data scientist.  The skill sets are extremely similar, and also, there are many data scientists who are hired by insurance companies.  I haven't finished watching your video yet but I already know, this is a REALLY good one whether in or out of insurance.\n",
      "Shane, I would highly recommend looking into sub reddit information. I looked into data science and when you go to the data science subreddit you will see how it is nearly impossible to get a job in data science. Usually people will go into something like Business analyst to data analyst to data scientist as a means of going up the scale. Also these subreddits will help you get a better idea of the requirements of different jobs. For instance in IT career questions even though IT may be a fantastic career eventually the vast majority of entry level starts at helpdesk with a salary of $15-$20 an hour and is there for a few years before being able to make something like sys admin.\n",
      "Thanks Alex for all the advice, I finally landed a job as a data analyst at a tech startup. If anyones interested, I made 143 applications, had 7 interviews and got 3 offers. The process from starting the google course to landing a job took just under 3 months (I was unemployed and working on this full time). Hope that helps anyone who's looking for their next job!\n",
      "Dear Alex... In 2 or 3 years from now I will look back at what I have achieved and I am pretty sure your channel will be one of the things I will be more grateful for... Thank you for all the important information you share here!! All my admiration from a Venezuelan young student living in Europe! :)\n",
      "Amazing video Alex! Can't believe I'm just watching this now haha. I'm a data scientist at a larger company and I wanted to also comment that there's also the data engineer role that is becoming more hot and covers the data cleaning and dashboard creation part :)\n",
      "Great job on being concise in your comparisons between the two different job titles! I begin my master's in data science this January!

      "Hello Alex, I currently hold a masters in healthcare informatics. I am having trouble finding a job in my field. I am wondering if I should be focusing on data scientist or data analyst. I don’t have much experience when it comes to SQL, Python etc . I am wondering if I should consider enrolling in a data analytics Boot Camp. What are your thoughts?\n",
      "Hey Alex, I'm a medical student who would love to work as a data analyst on the side, I found out there are no data analysts in the hospital I train in so I've been studying R programming since July, I got an online specialization in \"R programming for public health\" from the imperial college of London and an R programming course from John's Hopkins University, along with other research courses, I'll be introducing myself to the the doctors who conduct research in my hospital in January, do you have any tips for an aspiring data analyst?\n",
      "Hi Alex, you mentioned something about learning AWS/Azure for Data Analyst roles. Seeing that both of these cloud platforms have different courses/modules, where do you suggest we start from. Or is a generalist knowledge enough? Looking forward to your reply.\n",
      "I really like how simple your explanation about DS and DA, very helpful. I have been thinking to trying pursuing on DS career by following boot camp and course online, despite of my background as bachelor of economic. Did you have some insight for non-STEM background to undergoes this path? Thank you.\n",
      "Hello from Italy Alex, as a Data Scientist i can say that we are more focused on deployng new models into a business process that drives direct value, so the project management and the engeneering skills become really important (unix, professional coding, sql, git, spark, concept of testing and so on) because you have to ensure that the pipeline works in every situation even when you have really bad or poor annotated data. i don't think that you need a phd cause the algorithm that you use are pretty popular in the community (xgboost, bert, resnet and so on).\n",

      "Great advice on typing out other people's work. Myself as a beginner it's easy to get flustered on projects as some solutions/tools I have not yet been exposed to. By looking up other's solutions/work and typing them out it really helps me to understand the anatomy of the code. Furthermore, sometimes the solutions don't work as I am using python 3.10 and so I have to work out and start fishing around for the latest 'iteration' of the module/code and that actually helps to drive home the knowledge.\n",
      "This video is extremely accurate. I have had such a hard time learning how to be a data scientist. I am in a MS in Data Analytics program and feel that doesn't really provide any real direction. I don't know what I don't know and that keeps me from learning what I need to know. Seeing the path helps, thank you. I would like to say I have struggled to learn R and I seem to be getting SQL quickly and I think this will help my confidence. Getting one language down can help to learn another, just from a confidence standpoint.\n",

      "I'm trying to curve my career into the tech field after struggling for a few years with a worthless bachelors.

Would it be possible for me to get started in this field, and what are some job keywords and skills that I should look for?\n",

      "Sweet! I would also be interested in Business Intelligence jobs.\n",
      "I agree that the fears of full automation and a fully saturated job market are overblown but at the same time I think there's a real pair of twin concerns that people considering advanced education should be concerned about: democratization and the experience catch 22. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like your video alluded to what I mean by democratization quite well so I think we're probably in agreement there. A lot of programs focus on training people to understand the ins and outs of libraries like tensorflow, pytorch, and sklearn as well as how to mathematically derive and formally describe a bunch of models. I think a lot of the implementation of those models is routine and boiler-plate enough that it's ripe for \"automation\" using some kind of auto-ml, the sql-like syntax that redshift and BigQuery offer, or some managed product that abstracts the implementation away. This opens ML models up to the tech-savy but non-specialist employees who have a very firm grasp on the domain knowledge already, pushing the roles that require deep technical expertise farther out to data engineering and ML-OPs. We still need people to hyperoptimize models and do core research for critical applications but often it's just not business critical to hire full teams to read papers and install cutting edge deep learning models off of github all day.\n",
      "\n",
      "For experience I really think there's a cruel pattern emerging of people investing enormous amounts of time and money toward masters programs and endless self-teaching motivated by the perception that the industry is starved for people. This is where I think we disagree: the job opening numbers you present are accurate but you don't talk about how that need is distributed with respect to years of experience. The largest companies have well structured well funded teams that can afford to take on new grads that need training but a lot of companies are only interested if you have a proven track record and can convince them you can deliver value extremely quickly with little need for them to train or invest in you. I would love to see a graph overlaying the number of candidates at each experience level over the number of jobs searching for people at that level. My expectation is that you'd see a massive gap favoring employers at 0-2 years of experience and a massive gap favoring employees at 5+ years of experience. So while the industry is expanding, the companies aren't hiring juniors, or at least not at the rate you need to be optimistic coming out of an expensive not top tier masters program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together I think these trends speak to a frightening future for the opportunities for new data science professionals. If workers with domain experience (but not a DS education) can be hired directly into the junior roles given the democratization of the field and if education alone is insufficient to get you an entry level job I think we're going to see a very desperate job market for people trying to get into the industry. Perhaps what will happen is that new grads will need to pick an industry and work a non data science job for long enough to gain years of domain experience but that can be a hard sell after spending enormous amounts of time and money on a new degree\n",
      "Personally I think you hit one key point: the importance of domain experts.  With the so-called automation or new technology/ tools we'll likely see a shift to empower the domain experts and focus more on the business needs.  Just because someones knows SQL or do coding doesn't mean he/she can do data science or machine learning -- or more importantly, to put out anything meaningful or even useful.  Just like years ago people needed to rely heavily on someone who can do graphic design really well or who can use a handful of high-skill tools (say photoshop) really well to even modify a picture or video.  These days even kids can snap a picture or video and publish to Instagram or Tiktok.  Did the modern photo editing tools make graphic designer extinct? No.  But it does mean that you need to be REALLY GOOD to be able to survive as a graphic designer.  I see the same future for data science field too.  Maybe not tomorrow, but the trend is coming for sure.  If you pay attention to some of the podcasts like \"me myself and ai\", most the guests (chief data scientists or boss of DS departments) aren't really of these backgrounds but more business driven.\n",
      "The automation part was a matter of time, since a lot of the work with the data is repetitive. The understanding of the business and its needs have always been the most important part of Data Science.\n",
      "Working as a PhD in a business school we often get hookups with companies about some data... and it always shocks me how little they know. I'd say they are very good at collecting data but they often have no idea how to use it (that is if there problem is anything but a straight forward prediction problem). \n",
      "\n",
      "My understanding are the best skills to have are 1) be able to identify problems 2) be able to decide how to solve the problem. Once that is done, usually the process is just data cleaning and then running the libraries you decided on already which is fairly trivial (though potentially data cleaning is time consuming). But honestly, don't trust me. I had to go do a PhD because nobody would hire me to do even the most basic stuff...\n",
      "That's the point.\n",
      "For example, I work as BI Analyst, normally with Power BI, SQL and low-code platform (PowerApps, Automate...)\n",
      "I have a Master in Data Science and I know how to built Neural Networks from Scratch but...for what?\n",
      "Built a single linear regression model requieres a lot of steps and technologies, Azure, Python, Cloud, APIs, Devops...a lot of investment and maintenance,\n",
      "instead most of the tools which I work on, have integrated machine learning tools, as image recognition, NLP, classification... with a few steps and a clear suscription.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, I get my job because they demand for a person who knows analytics and have data science knwoladge so that can advice on the use of these integrated tools.\n",
      "No more import keras model.fit(), you will be requiered to matinenance and advice about machine learnings integrated tools.\n",
      "\"Prospective data scientists should focus on projects that demonstrate the ability to understand business context\"\n",
      "This! This is very important!\n",
      "Asking if Data Science is dying would be like asking if engineering or medicine is dying. There will always be a huge demand for these sorts of careers. Tons of people thinking they want to do them is a byproduct of that. But just like engineering and medicine, most people who think they want to be in the field can't really hack it (for whatever reason). If you are someone who is smart and hard working, you don't have to worry about the field being \"saturated.\" Most of that saturation is from people who aren't very good or who call themselves data scientists because they completed a mooc or two. There's a huge difference between completing certs and degrees and being able to actually do things in the real world. The wheat gets separated from the chaff pretty quickly.\n",
      "The whole data science industry is booming from analyst to engineers to scientist and you will see domain experts leading this field more and more\n",
      "What a beautiful and insightful explanation of the dynamics of data science. It is true that data science demand is growing exponentially and what aspiring data scientists are fearful is lack of knowledgeable that DS is actually evolving and diverse. It is become more field specific and one need to master the area of expertise like health, business, banking etc in respect to the application of DS in it. Thanks a lot Thu Vu for your resourceful info.\n",
      "Data science is extremely saturated at entry level, just ask anybody who's applied for a data science job in the last year. Moreover, data analyst is being rebranded as data scientist because many businesses are realizing they never needed fancy deep learning or advanced statistical models to gain insight into their data, but good ole basic analysis achieved the same end at a fraction of the cost. If you actually want to work on AI projects these days and not just be a data analyst you'll need a PhD in computer science. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also despite having a higher barrier to entry the outlook for data science jobs is worse than that of software engineering because the demand is a lot less compared to software engineering. As data science tools continue to be democratized and automated, software engineers with basic stats skills will be favored for data roles due to their better coding skills, as well as the fact that the job is just an analyst role, so no longer requires advanced stats knowledge for the most part.\n",
      "This video was soooo informative and encouraging. I’m a neuroscience major looking to enter data science after college and have been trying to focus my skills in learning R, data visualization, and statistical analysis. Class of ‘23!\n",

      "I so needed this video today! I just finished my Masters in Data Analytics and as someone who has always despised job hunting I was getting disenfranchised.

      "hey, awesome vid! I was a data analyst before I had a maternity leave and I wanted so much to become a data scientist because I think it's a logical progression of my work challenge path. Unfortunately, currently I have different plans for my life but I wanted to say that you made me come back to my prev plans and inspired me again on the topic.\n",
      "Great video! I'm quite interested in pursuing a career in data science in the future, and I'm wondering if you've got any tips/tricks for someone who's somewhat got his basics down. Looking forward to more of your videos!\n",
      "I have a very similar background to you. I am a former physics undergraduate that did research in high energy physics simulations, and that computational background really helped me transition into my current data science position. For any physics/math undergrads, you have the skill set to get into this field! The only obstacle is being able to express your math knowledge through code. If you can learn enough code to do that, you're golden.\n",
      "Thank you for this video!  Currently applying for a Master's in Data Science and this is great anecdotal support.\n",
      "Very informative video! I agree with many of your points, and I'd like to add some of my own (I'm a Lead Data Scientist at an American unicorn):\n",
      "\n",
      "1. We don't really care about your background as long as you can code (SQL and Python), understand the fundamentals of statistics and can apply standard ML models. Your education might limit your progress later on, but the basics are plenty enough for you to do well as an entry-level data scientist.\n",
      "2. Communication is _really_ important. We expect all new hires to be good on the technical side, so what ends up being the most significant discriminator between high- and low-level is how well you can understand what's being requested and what's important and communicate your results in a way that helps the business. This is the number 1 thing I mention to my reports during 1:1s.\n",
      "3. Many Data Science courses (BAs or Masters) don't teach SQL, or if they do, it's just basic stuff. Regardless of what your actual role as a data scientist will be, SQL will always be essential.\n",
      "Super informative thank you for all the info! I just switched majors from CS to I.T. And thinking of Pursuing a masters degree in data science. Do you think that the masters degree would make of a difference early on and for entry level roles? (Salary wise) Overall im just kind of trying to figure out where to go from here haha\n",
      "Thank you so much for the insight on data science as a \"new path\". I have degree on agriculture and now I'm just starting on takin course, professional certification and etc in data science (I'm more interested into this stuff than my main degree tbh lol). Mainly just to get into DS job, and also getting new skill to go along with my main degree seems pretty nice addition,\n",
      "Thank you for this course, sir. It was a great 12 hour journey. Coming from non CS background, I had little to no knowledge about all this stuff but this video has given me enormous amount of confidence that I can program and explore data science further. Thanks again!\n",

      "That’s a great concise video summing up the role of a professional data scientist, this video came at the right moment as I transition from academia to industry and totally relate with many of the points mentioned in the video. As mentioned in the later part of the video, I also find the undesirable aspect of data science to be a double-edged sword as on one end the ambiguity may make things unclear but at the same time also leaves room for experimentation and innovation. Papaya Tracker sounds like an interesting personal project!\n",
      "Im 35 years old, and I just started my Data Science journey by starting college this semester.  Been an aircraft mechanic for my entire adult life and been looking for a change for years now and you inspired me to finally pursue Data science. Thank You Ken, I'll be tuning into your channel just to keep my 'ear to the ground' in this exciting field. Also, not sure if you spoke on this before, but what laptop do you recommend for data science? Thanks Buddy and keep up the good work!\n",
      "Miss the times when data science was simply called statistics. Now every company wants a “Data Scientist” that can do:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Business management.\n",
      "2. Presentations.\n",
      "3. Data fetching and collection.\n",
      "4. Research.\n",
      "5. Model building and deployment.\n",
      "6. Model performance evaluation.\n",
      "7. Cloud environments.\n",
      "8. Database administration.\n",
      "9. Pipeline building and management.\n",
      "10. Client management.\n",
      "\n",
      "With statistician the responsibilities where quite clear because now every person that works on anything related to data is now a Data Scientist.\n",
      "This actually answered a couple of questions I had about working professionally. I know that SW Engineers typically work in an agile framework but wasn't sure if Data Science followed that same trend. Thanks Ken!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now to watch this 400,000 more times so we can beat Forrest.\n",
      "One of the most important things that I wish more people would do is documentation. Of datasets, sources, code, rationale etc. I often have to spend a long time on the dataset exploration phase of the project and trying to figure out things. Everything would be much smoother if people created detailed documents on the different Datasets, how things are collected, what features are used, distributions etc\n",
      "I’m 26 and I have one year left in my Data Science curriculum, plus my master’s program. Currently learning MySQL and I’m trying to learn Python and R on the side. It’s really tough since I’m in a data structures course using Java, and that takes up a good bit of my time. Hopefully it all works out for the best. \n",
      "Also trying to get a good grasp on machine learning and deep learning principles as I go, and making sure I’m sharp with my statistics and linear algebra skills.\n",
      "I'm working as an Associate Data Scientists at a startup and I honestly haven't needed to code for like 5 months. They've got me focused on an e-learning initiative.\n",
      "If you want a role where you want to work only with AI and heavy duty programming go for a machine learning engineer job, if you want to do statistics and sometimes classic ML and analyze data go for a data scientist job. \n",
      "\n",
      "Working as a ML engineer you spend way more time reviewing and maintaining code (so it's more SE from one side), you use python for model development and c++/java for production (the role is building AI products, so you are all day reviewing, extracting and preprocessing data to then training ML models, evaluate them and match required KPIs)\n",
      "\n",
      "In the other hand, data scientists positions offer what is described in the video: statistics and data preparation (engineering) and classic ML, there is more flexibility regarding tools and programming languages, and the final purpose is bringing value in a business perspective with the projects you have\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, In ML engineering you get assigned some set of models that you have to maintain and improve, in data scientist positions you get several projects that constantly change. Both roles have their advantages and interesting scopes\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been in both, my background is in statistics and I have been working as ML engineer in computer vision in the automotive industry for the last 3 years. Personally, I can say ML engineering is more fun, even more in start ups where you feel you bring a lot of value with your ideas about crazy AI methods\n",
      "Thank you for posting this video. This past year I migrated to a new work role and am listed by my employer as a data scientist.  This video confirmed my understanding and also cleared up confusion as many people, my employer, and consumers of our products have different views of a data science work role.\n",
      "As a data scientist myself, I agree that anyone can become a data scientist. It definitely takes a significant amount of time and effort though. I have multiple videos about how to get into the field on my channel for those who are interested!\n",
      "As a data scientist, I would agree with the fact that we are lazy people that want maximum results with minimum effort - and think we can solve any problem given enough data. :D\n",
      "'anyone can be a data scientist' - that's the gist of this lecture.....What it requires is a combo of math stats n computer science skills topped u with communication and management soft skills.....Data is the new thing from which physicists, engineers, social scientists can draw n infer conclusions based on past history or some kind of logic.......And this is the best time ever for fast processing of loads of data........Right time to be data scientist! You can work in any domain! Good introductory talk👍\n",
      "This was very precise and at the same time a very broad view at this field. Thank you sir.\n",
      "Thanks Mr.Asitang Mishra. You have motivated me more to pursue data science ❤️\n",
      "Inspiring, transparent talk! ✅\n",
      "Soooo good! I love it and Mr. Mishra's smart humor! Very good overview with some fun laughs in it too!\n",
      "Felt proud watching ✌️Being a data scientist I can relate what speaker said... Problem solving is the essence..\n",
      "thanks a lot, Mr.Asitang Mishra!\n",
      "you've convinced me to study DS more\n",
      "this talk was really the best of its kind 👍\n",
      "I don't agree with any of this. The only way to get a data science job is to first get a job as a janitor at an esteemed university. Start looking for math problems on chalk boards. Solve them. Become a professor. Solve math. Wait... this is the plot from good will hunting. Nevermind. \n",
      "\n",
      "In hindsight, this is really great advice. How about them apples.\n",
      "Great video Tina! Loving the minimize input maximize output (MIMO) series. My step into the world of data was from a non-technical (biology) background and persistence and grit was probably one of the most important thing because it took quite some time to digest the coding or algorithmic concepts. I also resonated with your prior MIMO video on learning data science particularly on learning just enough and start doing projects. I also leveraged data science to solve biology data problem (that helps to make a positive impact in this video) which at the time was a novel thing. I repeated this cycle for solving various biology data problems and before you know it, topics that I used to get stuck on became less intimidating and started to sink in. Your persistence through 200 SWE roles is very inspirational 😆\n",
      "Hey Tina, thank you so much for always sharing wonderful tips. It is almost approaching a year since I had finished my bachelors and still without a job :(! I really hope I can break the barrier and get my foot in the industry. Having zero experience makes everything harder. Apart from doing some projects, I will definitely try to contribute in open source projects or pick up a consulting assignment.\n",
      "I'm a Ocean Sciences BSc and now I'm starting another degree in Information Systems. Your channel is motivating me to follow the Data Science path. Keep up the awesome work!\n",
      "Amazing how much effort so many people put into to getting a job while someone with connection can bypass it all and get the job.\n",
      "Hi Tina, this was really great advice about demonstrating your impact, super useful for data science people but I feel like it's relevant to every field too. Please could you do a video on how you deal with rejection? I'm job hunting in a field that's very new to me (not data science) at the moment and I'm just so afraid of getting rejected because that could mean the end of my dream. Also, even if it doesn't, the feeling just sucks lol.\n",
      "Hi Tina! Do you think doing only analysis is good for your resume? For example, imagine that I scrape data from glassdoor and I do a analysis on the salaries of data scientists in the US. After finishing the analysis on the data, I got some pretty cool insights but I didn't use Machine Learning in the end project. \n",
      "So, is a project like that good for my resume?\n",
      "I'm a major in Data Science and your videos help a lot.\n",
      "Honestly, the frustrating thing for me at work as data analyst/scientist is I never saw our clients give any feedback about how our reports were helpful for them and change their projects. AKA. \"business impact like what you described.\" I always comfort myself that \"even just a little impact. and that's enough.\"\n",
      "Hi Tina, you make me want to make my first comment on Youtube - your videos are SUPER helpful and please keep making more interesting and insightful videos! I am actually thinking of transitioning to data science from a business background and you gave me a lot of useful tips that solves my confusion :)\n",
      "Hmmm I'm going the applied math route with stats as a minor or possibly masters. Is there any reason in particular that you would recommend CompSci beyond just the programming background it provides? Also, how different is data science compared to machine learning? They sound almost like the same thing (given their job descriptions). Great video btw!\n",
      "Glad we needed a scientist to tell us that you get rich by starting a business with a competitive advantage. :)\n",
      "I feel for a local business owner who opened up a coffee shop. My two sister's worked there and were very good friends with the owner since she was a teacher at the highschool and saved up enough money to open the shop up. Sadly during the pandemic my state nuked her businesses. My sister's lost their jobs while the governor praised herself about her actions and those evil businesses were destroying our state. She then proceeded to get caught twice having parties spending thousands on booze.  Actually watched dozens of business get nuked the same way fun times fun times.\n",
      "so as a technician I worked at a dealership (two actually) owned by the same guy. He has like 10 different dealerships and he is insanely wealthy. Like, he owns all of this property north of a major highway and is literally like a king in these lands. To be honest he also seems like a pretty nice guy.\n",
      "Since I was little I knew I’d rather live in the street than become a wage slave and have to relive the school experience of being told what to do. Having to negotiate with incompetent managers for a 5% increase every year just sounds insane to me. I studied software engineering so I could build my own tools and sell them. Took countless 70+ hour work weeks but the work does pay off now own half of a successful tech startup. Currently using that income to start two other companies with virtually no competition in my area in other industries I’m interested in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Entrepreneurship is the way. Made my first M at 26. Currently 27.\n",
      "TLDR:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) own something\n",
      "2) try to make it a monopoly (either legally or physically, e.g. tie it your personality)\n",
      "This actually makes a lot of sense. The company I work for has produced a lot of commercials for a regional car dealership/racing team owner. The owner of the company isn’t a billionaire, but is in a position where he can throw around money whenever he wants. That kind of path seems much more attainable than hoping you land a one in a million chance on a startup business or some Bitcoin related gamble.\n",
      "I'm a mortgage broker. He's completely right. Except the local monopoly thing can be done with a really good book of business. Sure you can compete but you can't steal my referrals which supply all the business. Offering a Lower price is a poor tactic unless it's purely how to learn how to run the business\n",
      "Depends also on what you define as rich. I don't mean that in a philosophical way either, just that living standards vary greatly from person to person. If you need to have a mansion, a yacht, and 5 or 6 super cars then it's a much greater challenge. Also, what are the time horizons? Is your goal to be \"rich\" before you turn 30? Or can you wait until 45? or 50? Because something else they didn't mention in the video is investment, compounding interest, passive income, etc.\n",
      "Being a trade professional such as plumbing or HVAC can be VERY lucrative if you spend the time and money to consistently build name recognition in your local market and maintain that for years. If you can become the name that people automatically think of for HVAC problems - you can multiple hire crews to do the work for you. You can scale as big as you want and easily become a millionaire - with a tech school diploma - you just have to grow that name recognition and provide quality service.\n",
      "Remember he’s a Data Scientist. He’s probably studied data on the topic immensely before this interview as that’s what we love doing especially with public data that’s nice to play with. So the advice he’s giving probably tends to bounce towards what’s most PROBABLE, not what will DEFINITELY make you rich. In most ways probability can you take you a long way.\n",

      "Absolutely the best video on statistics that I have found on YouTube - and I've viewed several such videos. I like that the professor explains a topic from many angles, has charisma, patience with class questions and includes many real-world examples. It's the perfect blend of theory and applied statistics.\n",
      "As practicing design engineer in West Cost medical industry, I find Professor Dr. Sarkar way of explaining the most complex subject in a practical approach very rewarding and helps in right metal representation for long term understanding. Although I have taken similar courses in Stanford paying close to 2K plus USD came out even more confused and even gave up statistical approach . Thanks for sharing for free and hope this benefits the transition from Excel based modeling to Python and would highly recommend to any one working with data and design.\n",

      "I absolutely agree with your comments about statistics and I love/own/have read the same book cover to cover. There is now a 2nd edition with python implementation. BTW, reason I am leaving comment is to hear your thought about the actual interview questions. I recently went through google data scientist interview (1 hour tech screen) and to my surprise, the question was straight out \"coin flip\" probability and expectation problem... I was really surprised because the question is very much contrived and I couldn't come up with the answer very easily at first. That was the only question (some resume related question before that, of course) I got in the session. As a data scientist myself, those type of questions are really hit or miss and personally I don't think it'd help to measure one's understanding of stats or technical background. How would you suggest prepare those?\n",
      "Thank you for such an informative video, appreciate people from real time experienceare sharing it with people which will he a great help to so many.., I'm working as a software engineer but don't think I'm good at technical so was thinking to move to non technical roles. And these thoughts are really tiring when u end up in too many options and not able to conclude. I am with Bsc maths and Msc computers background,  and in 2016 thought searched so much how to utilise my maths skills in IT, but unfortunately couldn't find so much that time..now when I hear on Data scene I feel I lost so much opportunity,  but I would like to resstart my learning and your videos are really inspiring. Is it okay for a person with almost 8years gap from Bsc maths to start on Data science now? Please reply\n",
      "thanks for sharing your experience in transitioning to data scientist role.  Some of your suggestion is good which is actually what I'm doing so far, watching different you tube video on on same topic because as you pointed out  different people has their own way of  interpretation of the subject and is more simplified , until you fully grasp the subject.  Please keep sharing your knowledge.\n",

      "Awesome video! I completed 2 years of medical school but had to withdraw due to my poor physical health (chronic pain). Computer science was my backup if I was unable to get into medical school. I'm currently learning python through Udemy's online course. The tech world is so broad and I feel overwhelmed. I'm hopeful that things will workout for me in the end, but med school debt is no joke.\n",
      "I’ve been been watching all of your videos while stressing about midterms! Currently still in my undergrad and I’m looking for a bit of advice. Currently I’m planning on majoring in computer science with a minor in statistics. Would a data Analytics, or information systems degree from the business school be better? Or should I stick with the more technical with CS with the stats minor? \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at data science jobs, nearly all of them I see require a masters degree or PHD, which I definitely don’t have the money for. I see plenty of data analyst and data engineer jobs that are open to the bachelor degree level candidates. Is making a transition from one of those two rolls into data science relativity easy?\n",

      "Very informative. I’ve got an engineering degree and had courses like probability & statistics, linear algebra, integral and differential calculus. I have a letter of acceptance from a community college in Canada for Business and Advanced Analytics in a post grad diploma program with subjects like python, sql, machine learning, etc. I’m studying python and data science online at the moment in preparation for my Winter 2023 intake. Will brush up my knowledge on statistics, linear algebra and calculus by August as this is a requirement by the program. Back in the days, I had the opportunity to represent our school in Math competitions. What surprises me is that I can still study for 5 - 8 straight hours everyday and sometimes forgetting my businesses as I now leave my managers to decide on their own. What do you think are the chances of people in their mid 40’s getting a job without experience as a data analyst or data scientist?\n",

      "I have a masters of data science but once I started working in a data position, I have realized that I enjoy more of the coding and building. Whether its writing Python, SQL, or R code for building and analyzing data, or building reports in SSRS, those are the aspects of my job that I most enjoy. I have been considering changing careers to software engineering. Also, I do feel like data scientists are expected to know too much these days. From communication, data visualization, statistics and deep learning, to cloud platforms, Spark and now Docker. That is a ton of skill and knowledge that seems super-human!\n",
      "You are the chill girl in every class who says she hasn't studied for exam but tops the whole college\n",
      "Great explanation: \"building products vs discovering insights\"\n",
      "As someone who is working in the Data Analytics side, I wholeheartedly agree with this. Data science is a new field which basically supports or optimizes how to do business. Software engineering leans more on building software or applications where normal people can use/consume. If you want to create your own business in the tech industry, software engineering should be necessary. If you want to support existing businesses, data science is the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm planning to create my own business on the food industry and I can see that data science can help it a lot.\n",
      "Thanks for the informative video!  Just a caveat on the salary comparison: data science often requires graduate-level education (Master's or PhD)/considers it an asset whereas software engineers do not. Or, if without a graduate degree, it's not uncommon to work as a Data Analyst for 1-2 years before becoming a Data Scientist. So while the average salary may be higher for Data Scientists, there's likely some additional education/work experience factored in.\n",
      "This is the most systematic and detailed review of any of the two careers I’ve ever seen. Thanks for this video, it definitely helped in finding my next step!\n",
      "This helped me soo much! I was really on the fence but I'm leaning towards Software Development just because I have serious doubts that I could present the Data in a parsable/usable way. \n",

      "You are the reason why I started programming. I'll never forget the things you've done to help me.\n",
      "Thank you so much! Very clear and neat explanation! I hope you will continue diving deeper into detailed concepts rather than concentrating only on basics. Your way of explanation plus the details would be the great video for all I think!\n",
      "Amazing tutorial! You explained everything so clearly and helped me to grasp some of the topics even better!\n",
      "Hey Mosh, your contents and teaching style  are straightforward and easy to follow. It would be great help if you do some tutorials based on medical imaging (CT,MRI) data! I am having difficulties in dealing with those. Thank you!\n",

      "As someone who's a relatively new data scientist, thanks for giving me all the confirmation bias that I needed Ken 😉\n",
      "Mathematics never dies. Programming Languages are rising and decline,  but calculus,  matrices and numerics will exists until the known universe ends\n",
      "Great insights Ken. I certainly agree that data science's decline is far from sight. In the life science domain, the use of data science has started to scratch the surface and there's a whole new frontier of possibilities.\n",
      "The sentiment is maybe coming from the difficulties to find your fist job if you are an aspiring data scientist. Rejection and unclear expectations (most companies have no idea how to find and sort data-scientists) may make many believe that is was just a fad, and they came a little late to the party.\n",
      "As a student in Data Science, in order to automate those tasks, AI needs to be much more advanced in order to actually do it so its still pretty far off.\n",
      "Great insights as always Ken! The data science umbrella is so large, that several \"titles\" will be more defined by companies to find the person with the skill set required to solve their problems.\n",
      "Just recently started my first role as a data analyst/consultant for a property consultancy, people in other teams and companies have told me about the struggle they are having finding data analysts.  I'm from the UK so this may of course differ where you are living but its clear new companies are realising how imporant data is.\n",
      "Data science is definitely not dying and for the fact it's only scaling much bigger. Companies have started seeing the advantage of using data and data science and organisations are adopting data which is in fact create more demand for data experts 💯.\n",
      "Currently building up skills to eventually try and become a data analyst! Enjoyed the dope content, should def do some more!\n",
      "Justin, not only great editng but loved how you shared the life of a data analyst!!  Looking forward to more content from you 🙌🏼\n",

      "Hi Priya- thank you for this video. I am concluding my last year as a student receiving my BS in data analytics. And I have so many questions that are causing me anxiety. As I am nearing the end of my journey I have realized that the path in computer science ( DS/DA) is not structured like one probably imagined it would be. What I am wondering is if you encountered the same during your journey in terms of learning these program tools (Python, SQL, tableau, R,) if what’s important while in school is getting a basic understanding of these tools and how to use them,  but the real challenge starts after graduating, in teaching yourself on how to use these tools more effectively to actually be able to draw meaningful insights ?\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you have to hone your skills a bit more once you graduated before you started to apply to jobs? I have beginner level on all these programs right now but I feel like I probably won’t be able to land a job in data analytics until I’m at least intermediate in SQL and at least Python, for starters. I would appreciate your feedback, and would also love to connect with you offline to chat if possible. Congratulations again on your journey and your role in data science.\n",
      "Thank you for this video. This is extremely helpful as I am currently applying to data science and quantitative analytics positions.\n",
      "Want to quickly commend you for the consistency and quality of your content. I don't usually comment - but from helping me with my UChicago application (where I will be attending next year :D) to now supporting me in identifying my future career (I am very interested in data science), I am grateful to you for all your work. Thanks!\n",
      "10:00 this is an extremely hard coding task. It deals with a custom data-type, implies the iteration and verification of the end. I wasted 40 minutes and didn't resolve it, all the solutions I have found, include flattering with a separate method, than iterating and len() verification. And the task is formalized in a way, that next() and hasNext() methods should be enough to do the flattening (which is again more difficult).\n",
      "I am not sure if it is a suitable task for a middle software developer in a fortune-500 company coding interview. Comparing this with the \"explanation of the gradient descend\" is like chalk and cheese.\n",
      "I’ve just concluded my bachelors in Civil engineering but I am inclined to move to the Data science field. During my course I learned how to program in phython(in Spyder) and SQL and I’m still updated with those skills. Imagine you are in my shoes what should I do moving forward to learn more about data science? and ensure I can  get a job at it? Do you think it is necessary to take another course? What are the general technical skills I have to master?\n",
      "Great video!  I appreciate the honesty.  Did you start as an analyst before moving to a Data Scientist role?  What role would you recommend for recent grads?\n",
      "A scientist who works in data science has been a godsend. Finding a job has been difficult in the wake of my graduation and several unsuccessful job applications. After weighing my options, I chose to leave physics and hunt for a position in data science. Before seeing your videos, I was baffled as to why I continued being turned down for jobs despite having two master's degrees, one in physics and the other in applied physics. Now that I've seen some of your vids, I understand why. Glad I found your channel on YouTube:)\n",
      "just start my datacamp journey, thank you for this helpful insight, I have one question, how do you know that some company just using you for their free project while they actually don't want to hire anyone.\n",
      "Very understandable approach to explaining the differences in these roles. It's definitely appreciated, especially with the blurred lines that companies often use to represent these fields.\n",
      "Really nice video. I am a current data analyst at a large tech company, hoping to become a ML engineer eventually (similar to a google software engineer whose capable of everything in that chart). Love the content, keep it up.\n",
      "great video! thanks for clearing that up and explaining the various elements of so many different roles in this field! very helpful.\n",

      "25 hours a day are possible on days where you return from daylight saving time to standard time.\n",
      "subs.. I've been seeing your video on my feed for a while now since I started roaming around to study software development but my true goal was to go up to the data scientist role, that's just the goal I have in mind and you just revealed to me that I don't exactly NEED to become a software engineer first if I can land myself to a data analyst role, the hierarchy showed me I can still walk up slowly to reaching my goal.. you are a god send.. :)\n",
      "thanks man for clearing this up... especially in India ...all IT companies have made a mess about Data jobs...why don't you make a video dscussing these JDs ...especially from India....? these all are MNC's\n",
      "That's a very nice explanation, I'd love to see each step in-depth\n",
      "Companies nowadays prefer a generalist over a specialist who is super expert at one specific field only. This is why developers experience burn outs so often, they have almost no option but to spend a great portion of their time trying out new tech, and whatever they learn will most likely be replaced by \"better\" resources.\n",
      "Yep, I can confirm as a PhD research scientist that I do in fact have a side kick ML engineer (actually 3) to help me create all my crazy shit.\n",

      "I once had a question, how the regressor would look like without any coeffecient except the intercept in a linear regression. Could not answer it right away, but got the to the answer after a couple of mins. I asked the job interviewer if anyone ever got it right after immediteatly and he said only one, but he did not hire him. So don't worry question aren't everything, its got more to do with the way you handle the situation with dignity and without being a liar.  Also keep your head up, iwrote hundred of applications and still ended up at a big corp.\n",
      "I love your videos! I had one quibble about your SQL solution to #1. If some publishers have more videos than others, then their video durations will affect the mean. You could imagine one publisher with 10,000 videos and 9 publishers with 10 videos. In this case, the average duration of that one super-publisher's videos will have way more influence on the mean than the other publishers. I think your question is better answered by first computing an average for each publisher and then averaging those averages. (of course, this detail may not matter in an interview)\n",
      "LOL very impressive that you can make a video about interview questions so fun to watch 😂 🙌\n",

      "I think this is a good video for suggestions on how to get a data science job at a larger company. However in my experience data science interviews at non-large companies put a huge focus on machine learning/deep learning, linear algebra, statistics, core python programming (sometimes R), SQL, spark/AWS/GCP, and data visualization (tableau, matplotlib, R)\n",

      "Hi Jonathan, awesome video. Please rate the online data science or big data courses and share your opinion regarding if they are any good in landing you a job vs a Masters in CS.\n",
      "Hey Joma - the new thing now in Data Science interviews is 'modelling' questions (makes sense, really). Curious if you would do a video on how to prepare for that? For many companies, that is the make-or-break portion of the DS interview process.\n",
      "Data Nerds! What skill are you currently working on that is a non-technical skill (I.e. soft skill, analytical skill, domain knowledge)?\n",
      "Dude love the cut outs! Great video!\n",
      "Maaaaaan, the way you explain stuff makes me feel like this is something reachable, despite of its level of complexity. You make it sound, somehow, easy. Not because it is, but because you suggest a self development path for those who want to learn on their own. There are many out there who put themselves on a superior position, maybe caused by their formal-education ego, but for some reason you must follow their same steps, which means you'll never be as awesome as they are. \n",

I'm going to pursue a MSDS soon, and I'v learned python ML,  MySql, and some Hadoop during my free time, beside working on some resume projects and keep practicing the skills, are there anything I can do to ensure myself getting an intern? Thank you very much!!!\n",
      "Hey Tina! I'm about to watch this video, after initially stumbling upon your video on the scoreboard. You're a really awesome person, and I really appreciate the effort you're putting into creating these videos. I haven't watched this current one yet, but it'd be great to hear what's changed over the year, if anything. I can already tell your editing and recording quality has improved a ton, and that's not a sleight. I'm excited to learn, thanks again!\n",

      "Thank you for this video. I dont know even a single alphabet in this subject when compared to  all other viewers. But now a days I hear a lot about Artificial intelligence, ML, DL & DS  around me. So I thought to at least know what they mean. I struck the correct video at the first attempt and I put your lecture in white and black which came to 2 pages while viewing and hearing . The lecture was so crystal clear that me who does not have any knowledge in software (I just use word & XL for my job) has come to know about the above 4 subjects to the extent what you delivered. If I have understood, then the people who are already in this subject  would have got a lot of useful information. Now If I tell to my son who works for a software company about this subject he may feel surprised that how I could knew about this subject. Thanking your Sir once again. I am 57yrs old, can I learn and become DE or DA or DS\n",

      "I have been a data scientist for three years. As a data scientist, one can only be a generalist until and unless he has domain knowledge of the field his company works in. The fascination with data science dies down once the projects are not relevant to your field of interest/domain of expertise. Moreover, companies now have a hard time justifying the massive amount of investment done towards data science. It's better to be a domain expert and then add skills of data science rather than just being a generalist data scientist without any domain expertise. Hence, I'm leaving data science and starting my PhD 😂\n",
      "I am a Structural Engineer. This is a good field for data science since most civil engineers don't learn programming/coding and when they do they just shift to IT industry. Data science will be very crucial for monitoring the life of structures.\n",
      "I agree to some points but disagree to some, I don't think studying Data Science  and knowledge gained will be worthless in 5-10 years. The core statistics and maths learned in the degree will be useful decades to come. Yes some aspects of tech stack will change but the same thing happens in other computer science fields as well. The Data Science is very broad field and if one does degree in this field they can transfer those skills into multitude of other fields and can create value for the company and lastly career trajectory in this field is still not fixed as this is nascent field and we don't know how things will pan out in 10-20 years down the line.\n",
      "Dear Sir, Data Analyst and Data Scientist shares a lot's and lot's of diffrence btw them. Data Scientist have to deal with AI which requires data to built  an algorithm based on machine learning.Self driving cars requires AI, Biotechnology companies requires AI. And in the age of AI,no one can stops AI and Data Scientist to thrive.And every profession always have pros and cons.Nothing in world is perfect.Ask yourself sir,Is Computer Science was in demand, back 20yrs,as it was now?🤔😊\n",
      "Namaste Sir, that was a really informative video. Actually a lot of professors from IITs also have quoted this issue of growing 'false love' among students for Data Science & AI. The whole crux is that these things are just merely tools to solve research problems in other domains and thus making computational easier. Just like a bridge which connects two islands. Most people do not understand this logic and hence go forward in this career because it is in ''demand\". You have demystified many myths via this video 👏.\n",
      "Also Sir, what is your take on pursuing advance degree in Nanotechnology because am an ECE student and really interested to do research in this area.\n",
      "Thank you professor for giving such crucial information. How about MIS (Management in Information Systems) for MS in USA. Does even that has the same supply-demand ratio problem? or is it safe bet to pursue masters in that field? Throw some light on it professor!!\n",

I initially thought of doing a masters in cybersecurity or data science. As I felt that AI would conquer the cybersecurity and data  in future, I'm searching for an explaination. You explained very well sir. Could you please tell whether there would be opportunities for those who have switched the carrier to AI field? Much merits to you sir from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰\n",

      "Hi Sundas! I am a chemical engineer working in industrial automation for several years. I spent several years drawing conclusions from tons of process trendings and doing data visualization (when I I didn't know what it really was) until I found your IG and that's when I knew I was into data analytics. I am doing the Google data analytics certificate course and it is great so far. I am also hesitating to stepping into the data scientist role but I will see how the data analytics goes first. Thanks for inspiring me to give my career a new direction !( Changing at 35 is not easy!)\n",
      "Thanks so much for clearing it out. I am learning data science on my own. I started learning statistics few months ago, almost done. I was a little confused and restless if i made the right choice by learning statistics first. I read a lot of comments on quora where people said that coding should be the first step, it didn't make much sense to me. Now its all clear and i have gained confidence after watching your video. I have a similar road map to what you just said. Thanks so much for inspiring and giving us so much info. All the best and really looking forward to watch your future videos.\n",

      "This video is really good and legit. I do however want to point out that you can still accomplish huge things in game design on your own or with a small team this day in age. There are incredibly powerful tools available for cheap and even free. The learning process to build an entire game is long, and difficult. Especially if you're thinking of an rpg. In my experience, single player games can be done fairly simply with alot of knowledge and experience, multiplayer games are a stretch to even try(alone or with a small team). But don't let the reality beat you up. If you really really want something, you can make it happen. I've been making games with blender and unity for nearly 6 years, and have prototyped/concepted my own rpg 5 times. Only now in 2022, am i confident enough to build the official version. But I've done it. I've learned enough to make it happen, and you can too. (Knowing is one thing, then you have to put in the years of hard work that still exist to bring it to life).

My game (SHAMELESS PLUG, LINK ON MY CHANNEL TRAILER) was a complex effort where I learned a lot about animation, music, and sound mixing.  Some seemingly simple things, like sound settings and zoom, took the longest during development, and when it was all over, people who played my game said it was pretty good, but it was hardly even seen by anyone.  The marketing thing was something I never considered, so it's going to be a focus with my next game.  I made a game, and this video was so incredibly accurate to my journey, learning how much work everything is and my scope was too big in places, and that I naively expected Steam to give me enough visibility to get the game out there.  If anyone's wondering how accurate this video is, the answer is somewhere around 120%\n",

      "I think the best part of this video is that his advice can be used for more than just game development.\n",
      "The most important thing I took away from my programming professor is: if your code is doing the thing you intended it to, that's the right way to do it.\n",
      "Don't get hung up on 'doing it the right way', you can always optimize later\n",
      "It's two different things; to start learning and to make your first serious game. When you start learning, if you go straight away to make your \"dream game\", it will likely be frustrating, because you have a vision of the game in your head but you can barely translate any of that vision into an actual game. Creating a copy or a \"remake\" of an already existing game that you like is a good way to learn. When I started learning Unity, some years ago, after doing a few tutorials I decided I would create a \"remake\" of Duke Nukem 3D, using some of the assets of Duke Nukem Forever and remaking the first level of the game in Blender, this was so that I could focus mainly on the coding side of things and put the creative part of it aside for the project. It took me, I believe, 6 months to finish it, it had all the basic game mechanics and the first level of the game, and yes, it played terrible and nothing like the original. But the amount of learning I did thanks to this learning project was really a lot, I don't think I could have learned faster other way. Another point I would mention is: learning to code: I think was the most important thing I did. When I started making games my game ideas were limited to what I imagined I would be technically capable of implementing, after I got a good grasp of coding I feel and I know I could make anything I can imagine, given the time to do so.\n",

      "Hi everyone! I realized I didn't actually describe my first role in the industry but it was essentially focused on monetization within games (that's why ethical monetization is my specialty now). So for sure, there's data analysis because we need to be comfortable with leveraging large amounts of data to make good decisions. It also encompasses monetization and systems design - though I wasn't formally trained in monetization design before joining (it's actually not a common designer specific skill so most of us learn this skill by joining the industry first). Monetization design encompasses things like battle passes, loot box designs, game ecoystem design (hard currency to soft currency, what resources are tradable and purchasable, etc.), designing events and seasons (what content should be available, how is it distributed, what does progression and rewards look like in an event, etc.) and ofc the pricing of it all. We also need to have business savvy because we need to lay out beforehand what success looks like and determine if the choices we make are good ones. We often look at things like player sentiment and satisfaction, purchase regret, MAU, revivals, etc to get a sense of this. \n",
      "\n",
      "My role today though focuses on a broader list of things, not just monetization but particularly engagement and retention as well! I made a video about what the responsibilities are so feel free to check that out :)\n",
      "This video was really inspiring and insightful to watch! Thank you for sharing your story and also the tip on “Skillset to Interest Framework”. I never thought of that idea, especially since I am someone who doesn’t necessarily know what roles I would be a best fit for, but also that matches my current skillset. Still in the process of exploration. Anyways, thank you for the video! :)\n",
      "Great to hear your story! Was an amazing journey. Please use your smarts for good and make game monetization less predatory for all who play the games you work on. It's an incredibly important issue and I'm so happy to hear that people are thinking about and specializing in work like that.\n",
      "Hi Morgan! Just want to tell you that I really loved the \"Skillset to Interest\" Framework. It really did a good job. I'm not a game-related worker but this thing helps me up to retrospect my career skill set. Thanks for making this video!\n",
      "Loved this video! There are so many videos that just say \"do this, this and you'll eventually get into the industry\", but you managed to break your journey down into a series of manageable steps. Looking forward to seeing more content from you!\n",
      "Only halfway into the video. The way of breaking down the job roles within the industry has been immensely helpful and information friendly to new gamers, designers or hopefuls wanting to join the game industry.\n",
      "tldr: she's not a game developer. she's a sales/business analyst/program manager. this video didn't really help me, but others might find your mechanism useful if they are interested in considering job requirements to your skill set framework, which to me seems obvious, but nothing wrong with that.\n",
      "It's a very informative video and it's genuinely interesting to hear your journey. On the other hand, the title is definitely a clickbait. The video has very little to do with how to become a developer. Rev analyst is not a developer, nor is the product manager role.\n",
      "Morgan this is awesome! One, because I love league of legends (been playing since like season 6) and it's just amazing to see people that have a vision for their life, plan, work hard to achieve it and succeed.

      "Reminds me of the first semester of my game design masters, we had a course that was just making a game, in groups of 5. After week 1 of \"production\" everyone presented their current state and this one game just looked amazing. I felt so jealous of how quickly they got their game looking so beautiful, but when the proffessor was giving feedback he asked \"why does it look so pretty?\" as a critique for this exact reason. He seemed almost mad they made things so pretty so early, because it was too early too tell if their idea worked, yet they had spent time making it look amazing.\n",

      "Have you considered using the \"recoil\" of the magnet when you catch it to give you a little push, maybe as a kind of \"directional\" double jump?\n",
      "Another really important aspect of prototyping is learning whether you actually ENJOY game design or not. If you're having more fun coming up with the story, setting, lore, and themes than you are experimenting with gameplay ideas, then chances are you're more into worldbuilding than game design. Learning this early can help steer you towards your strengths and interests.\n",
      "Hey man, I've been building these, let's call them \"prototypes\" for many years. I'm a programmer and game designer (and always wanted to be ever since a kid and been following that passion since ye old newground days), but when it comes to art I just shut down. I'm genuinely awful at the art part. So I've always teamed up with artists. Problem is I then get bogged down with the project management aspect and art pipeline systems instead of the art that it's wildly impacted my focus on the gameplay aspect, and it suffers as a result. Eventually everyone burns out and the project peters off for something new and shiny using what we've learned. \n",

      "Most of what you're talking about here is called \"abstraction\", despecifying capabilities in order to make them generic and reusable as well as linking related settings and configurations to minimize the effort required to make further changes. It's a core tenet of software development and my primary concern when designing application enhancements for my job. I'd much rather spend the extra time up front designing something that not only solves the current issue, but also related past issues as well as potential future ones. In the end, if done well, it significantly reduces overall complexity while skyrocketing maintainability. It's also a puzzle that I tend to take as personal challenges.\n",

The doors weren't like the key type so it doesn't make sense to open them with it, also it's kinda weird to just throw them thru the pipe... maybe a fuse or something that restores the energy will be better\n",

Well, I'm working on my framework, and I look at the level I've built alongside it to not only test the framework features but also to figure out what else needed to be added, and I realized, I basically just built a pre-alpha demo for my game; all I need is to make the level actually look good (because my level design skills are awful) and I basically now have a pre-alpha project. It's funny how that can happen sometimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either way, I always take this stuff seriously. Frameworks are everything in my opinion - having a solid framework with abstract tools that you can basically just take and drop anywhere will make your life so much easier, since you can basically just plug it into any project you start and just run with it.\n",

      "I was about to start making my first game my “dream game”. Glad I saw this and now I’m gonna get a few small games under my belt before my dream game.\n",
      "I started my 2D platformer when I was just starting to learn Unity and C#. I ended up taking a break to make a smaller game; a 2D bullet hell shooter called HyperShot. I put it on Steam, and I still get a sale now and then. Now I'm almost finished my platformer, which will be on Steam next year.\n",
      "Hey, glad to see this, I'm about to start making my first game. Thomas always has the best advice\n",
      "Tip # 1 - Consider your hourly rate as a dev, and its relation to your budget.\n",
      "Tip # 2 - Don't make everything from scratch. Time is money!\n",
      "Tip # 3 - Don't make your first game your dream game. It should be your 15 minute crap game. You'll figure out your strengths.\n",
      "Tip # 4 - Focus on prototyping. It's easier to build in pieces, and funding will motivate you.\n",
      "Tip # 5 - Build a community. Discord and Social Media.\n",
      "I wanted to make a 3D survival game, with a massive map with multiple biomes, weird animals, diseases, allergies and of course cut scenes. once I drew the design on some paper I realized that I never had coded before, so this would be way to hard. now I watched this video and I think my first game will just be a simple platformer.\n",
      "These are some amazing tips and the one about not doing everything from scratch really made me realize how much time I'm wasting.\n",
      "As for games I worked on a game for most of last year and now that I look back on it I made a lot of mistakes mostly related to planing but I did find out I am much better at programming and designing systems than actually making art plus I learned a lot about the type of games I am mostly good at making\n",
      "Your tip about knowing your forte really resonated with me. I too pride my self in character building and story telling. Those are my passions what keeps me making my game. This being my first game you’re other tip was perfect, I should make a small short game before putting my all into my dream story / dream game. This video hit at the perfect time for me, and thank you for your content. One question about your stories, do you have them all laid out first before you start building your games or do you kind of build the story and the small details of the story as you go, drawing inspiration from some of your worlds and art?\n",
      "I did release my own game on iOS about ten years ago. It was the only personal project I ever released. I outsourced all the creative assets just to save myself time. Crossing the finish line with this stuff is very challenging. I totally agree making your crap game first is the way to go. Great video!\n",
      "I really enjoy these tip type videos Thomas. They are really motivating. I have my first small-sized project game in mind and it motivated me to not b afraid of using assets if needed. Thanks for being motivating. Proud to be part of the gamedev community. :)\n",
      "Cool video, I always enjoy seeing game developer improvement over time. Keep going!\n",
      "Bro this is awesome!!! Keep up the good work man! Ik that your work will shine at one point😄🤩\n",
      "Keep up the good work!\n",
      "Awesome stuff!\n",
      "Cool video! Keep making the content, its very fun to watch! Though it does keep me of from doing my homework.. Oh and um… make a game for ios next? :s\n",
      "Well done\n",
      "Really good video it’s similar to mine but better! lol!\n",
      "Thanks for the insight\n",
      "Super underrated video and now I got inspired to make a gta clone too\n",
      "Actually underrated\n",
      "Can't wait until the game releases! :)\n",
      "I love your videos and happened upon then through my recommended feed. By showing all of your thought processes going into your designs and wealth of knowledge of architecture, your passion made me want to support you and Chef RPG through Kickstarter. I can't wait to see the final product and finally hop into the world you created 😁\n",
      "The game has a really nice identity, I'm happy to contribute to it, Noah manages our project wonderfully and Nikita impresses me since the beginning with his pixel art. 😎\n",
      "I really like the path this game is going towards, the world looks and feels alive yet captivatingly out of this world. I would love to help you in a way, English and Turkish are my primary languages, so you can reach to me if you need any translation work to Turkish in the future, since that's all I can do :))\n",
      "OOOH ! IT IS SO GOOD TO SEE THE NEW IN-WORLD CHARACTER'S SPRITES ! also some of the latest decors look soo insane ♥️ you and clement did such a great job 😄\n",
      "The new character sprites look so good! Seems like you’ve come so far in such a short amount of time. With the amount of detail and complexity in not only the art, but the code, I assumed you were a seasoned game designer and programmer when I saw your 1st devlog almost 2 years ago. I was impressed then and even more so now watching Chef RPG progress and improve as you continue to grow as an artist and game developer. It’s not only fun but incredibly inspiration for the rest of us indie game dev. I can’t wait for the next update!\n",
      "The complexity throughout blows me away. There's enough going on in a single indoor restaurant screen to make a fixed screen game out of that. Instead, you're making a game with loads more to explore and do. The amount of generosity it takes to make this much content is what I love most and is just as difficult to achieve as making a great game in the first place.\n",
      "omg the new character sprites look fantastic!! the combination of someone with architectural experience, a character artist and a sprite artist sounds very powerful\n",
      "love the thought that went to this game's design and the improvments and overall progress you made thus far. really glad i was able to back this project.\n",
      "Respect for all your hard work bro. The game looks so amazing. modern day art!\n",
      "You guys should get a world wide credit for any improvements in the field of CSE in upcoming years. Thank you for giving us these things for free.\n",
      "I'm only two hours in and I feel like my brain is swelling and going to burst out of my eye sockets, ears, nose, and mouth from all the pure knowledge you're giving me. Thank you. This is the tutorial I was looking for. You're actually teaching me the terms and functions and what they mean, and not just teaching me how to copy text. Thank you.\n",
      "this just shows how good youtube can be for teaching, several one hour long lessons compressed into a single video for everyone to watch for free no matter where you are\n",

      "I know it's corona times but look at all the resources that are available for free. what a time to be alive love it\n",
      "OMG, you don't know how thankful I am for this tutorial. I've been trying to find a tutorial that explains every single thing in a line of code for me for so long! Thank you so much!\n",
      "Very good tutorial ! Even if this tutorial is one year old, I'd like to add something. For the inheritance, I think it would've been worth mentioning the \"Protected\" accessibility level for variables. For those that don't know, a Protected variable is the same as a private one, except that the variable will be treated as if it was public for the child classes. It's pretty useful in cases like the one shown in this video.\n",
      "7 hours of free  content actually teaching you something and for free. Thank you!\n",
      "I wanted to thank you so much for this tutorial! I'm a total beginner and everything is explained so well and in a pleasant pace. Also I'm very thankful for the nice structuring of the video, which really helps going back and finding the topics that you need easily. Thanks a lot for your effort, it really is helpful!\n",
      "Fantastic game with seemingly endless potential. Other games in this genre feel outdated in comparison. Impressive for EA release.\n",
      "31:50 I really like the name Sapiens that you landed on. Because that name isn't JUST prehistoric humans. It is a game about Sapiens. It could be prehistoric, medieval, modern, future, or anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of this you aren't stuck with only cavemen. It can go as far as you want and the modders want.\n",
      "I’m addicted to this game!!! You gave me the game I’ve wanted for years! Thank you 🙏🏾\n",
      "I discovered this project literally a few hours ago, and now just minutes ago you upload a video discussing launch! I have missed so much, but I’m very much looking forward to release!\n",
      "Been playing this game for the last week and it's brilliant! I'd love to see some sort of interaction with Rivers and the \"terraforming\" that can be used to create Sapien-Made Canals and such! Looking forward to the future updates 🙂\n",
      "Your reaction to the release at the end with your family was so fucking wholesome. \n",
      "Congrats! You are living the game dev dream\n",
      "1:03:08 since we are talking about mines I wanted to ask you how you and the community feel about horizontal mines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I understand that the way that the terrain functions this is simply just impossible with your way of digging which is better for pit mines (which I love because they leave a large impact on the world!) But it can be quite difficult to mine in very mountainy terrain as the slopes become too steep very often.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is why I thought that perhaps we could have some sort of structure like a mineshaft entrance that would then allow your camera to get underground and for you to mine shafts with a line tool like how paths are made and hopefully fences in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "There could be various widths for technologies in the future like extra wide shafts for minecarts (or tunnels with trains perhaps but that is FAR later into development.) You could also have parts that would allow you to make stair or ladder rooms to go up or down a level to make more compact or deeper mineshafts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The way the terrain works currently actually really works with with that level system as when your dig out a secondary entrance it will be on a level already to match the tunnel networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "A MAJOR issue with this though is how the camera system would work... I could imagine a top down view working pretty well when building the tunnels however I feel like that might not fit the game. (I wouldn't have an issue with it but others may.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course you can always do your standard 1st person view to walk around the mines if you want to but that wouldn't work when trying to make mineshafts I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: I guess maybe you could still do your 1st person view if you could somehow make it look like you were actually underground and not just floating under the world and seeing through the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing I thought of though is that this system would actually allow you to dig below sea level as all you would need to do is not render water underground... I say that as if it is easy when I actually know hardly anything about game development but I do believe that should be achievable.\n",
      "\n",
      "But going far underground would allow you to find metals that you normally wouldn't which I think would be cool... Of course it would probably be behind some kind of research that would allow you to brace your tunnels or something to prevent collapse.\n",
      "It’s been an amazing journey to follow ! Absolutely crazy to think I was just 9 when you started work on this— congrats on the early access launch !! :D\n",
      "Been one heck of a ride watching this project for the past few years and finally seeing it come together! You've made something really special and I wait to see where you go from here!\n",
      "Following the development of Sapiens has been a lot of fun, I hope the game continues beeeing developed for a long time\n",
      "And really, well done making the game (its amazing) and pushing through past the honeymoon period of the development process\n",
      "Hey everyone, instead of the normal devlogs I put together this short summary of how I got into gamedev. I hope this is interesting and if you haven't already, consider subscribing :) The next video will be a normal devlog again.\n",
      "As a software engineer I'm doing everything the exact oposite way you are :D The code being the easy part and graphics being the hard part...  You are really artistically talented, love to follow your devlogs!\n",
      "Super inspiring, I'm about a year and a half into my learning and it makes me feel a lot better about abandoning projects.\n",
      "Amazing how much history and experience goes into what looks like a relatively simple game. You make it look so easy, but it’s so much more than meets the eye\n",
      "6 years, that's incredible! Loved hearing about how you started, think it's quite interesting to see how you love for drawing/modelling got you into making games :)\n",
      "That's awesome. Looks like it was a long journey but you've learned a lot! I'm currently on about my 15th overly-ambitious, doomed project but I hope I can finish something decent soon.\n",
      "I just want to appreciate the amount of effort you've put into making actual projects. I often find myself just fiddling around with ideas in my head and not making any project myself. I feel that has been a limiting factor in my learning. But this video has been super inspirational. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have been wanting to make my own devlog series but I was not able to stick to a project long enough. Till now, I have been wanting to make devlogs and work on a small project for a timeline of 3 months. And just finish a full game. \n",
      "Any tips to just stick to it?\n",
      "Absolutely loved seeing some of the old insect designs, super cool stuff!\n",
      "I've been struggling to get anywhere with my project. I'm glad you haven't given up and I love the asthetic and ideas you have for your current project. Don't give up!\n",
      "Your progress over the years is astounding. This new game you've been working on looks amazing and is just the sort of game I would love to play. I hope you keep at it.\n",

      "It's so great to see you talk about game design, I really think you should make a separate video about each one of those themes. I see a lot of developers that know how to make games but don't really know how to make them fun, and if you can teach them that, you'll be one step ahead of pretty much every channel like yours.\n",
      "Great video!\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be overwhelming for someone just starting out. But actually, you are not saying that we have to be expert on all of these, but mentioning important aspects of each. For example, the part of rules and the events in the game was great, and even though it seems obvious, i never thought about that. I don't make games myself though, but i find game making incredibly interesting, and difficult.\n",
      "Thank you brackeys ive had so much trouble with designing my own games thanks for sharing your knowledge with everyone.\n",
      "You give great tips and info that are worth so much more than the time you spend making them. Please keep up the great work and we will all keep watching.\n",
      "The first game is Wonder and so well polished. Imagine if it was released in 90s it would've wiped the market\n",
      "All these games seem pretty good, but the first is definitely my favourite. The second game looks nice enough, however the gameplay looks rather bland.\n",
      "the first game is awesome\n",
      "the second one just did what you wanted him to but nothing more\n",
      "the third one was quite cool but a bit boring, also is horror game material\n",
      "the fourth game looked like if it was made by a 10 year old but still cool\n",
      "Based on their Fiverr pages the first game appears to have cost $25, the second $35, third $5, and last one is listed at $30. I would have to say #1 was easily the best investment.\n",
      "The first game could end up being successful with proper funding and development. I love the idea of the recoil that launches you. Imagine that they added bosses, multiplayer, etc.\n",
      "The first one definitely felt more varied and had more to it, compared to the others. Which, they DID do what they were requested, but the other 3 just looked...generic in a way? While the first had enemies with AI that would attack you, interesting level design, and the movement and gunplay had more personality to them(being able to move the gun in any direction, using recoil to jump/lift off the ground), as well as different types of guns to play with. I guess it just had more polish to it, compared to the others too.\n",
      "The third game looks like it will change into an creepypasta type of game\n",
      "What were the costs for each one? That's very important. The first one stands out a lot. The others feel very dull.\n",
      "The developer of the first game is sick 🤯... Great game!\n",
      "The first game was a really clever reference to no time to explain, with very similar mechanics, and pretty much the same genre\n",

      "Been in game development at least 14yrs now, I literally lost track. Greatest advice given here is to target a niche and do something special: platformers and zombie games are a dime a dozen. Pick out something unique that's cool, maybe something that no one has done in many years. That's how Stardew Valley blew up on Steam.\n",
      "Tip #1 can’t be stressed enough, I spent my first year learning courses on coursera and udemy, thinking I’d get into game design once I’m “ready”. That day never came, no matter what I learned I never felt ready yet. Then one day I just started working on my project and said I’d learn new things where I needed to. Honestly doing things this way made me progress faster than any course ever has\n",
      "I have to agree: There is no shame in having the docs open all the time. Memorizing everything isn't what gives you skill. The important skill is knowing where to find the details when you need them.\n",
      "Not sure if it's mentioned in this video, but something I feel should be said in every tips video like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "DON'T DO YOUR DREAM PROJECT FIRST\n",
      "\n",
      "You will ruin it, if you don't give up first\n",
      "The tip I see missing from all of these videos is: Take inspiration from *wide* sources. Not just your favorite games. What's the GOOD in the game you otherwise hate? What do you like about that book you just read? How can you incorporate colour like they do in that movie you watched?\n",
      "\n",
      "This is what they mean when they say \"Good artists copy, great artists steal\". When you steal something you *make it your own*, and if you steal from a diverse set of inspirations, it becomes truly yours.\n",
      "You didn't waste those 2 years. You learned so much. You did so many things. These things add up in the future. We think we can learn everything in YT videos, but experiencing it firsthand gives you a much deeper understanding of things\n",
      "Shaders were super intimidating, but I spent a weekend learning them, and am so glad I did it. I feel pretty fluent in them not even a week later, and have been using them nonstop. I needed to use them for one effect, but the applications where shaders are useful keep appearing. It’s definitely a tool worth having in your arsenal. And like visual scripting vs actual coding, being able to write your own shaders allows you to do performance things you wouldn’t be able to do with visual scripting a shader.\n",
      "Imo something that's Extremely underrated, especially for programmers is learning to use programming design patterns early on. Observer pattern is a MUST for game dev with larger projects. Having objects that fire events and other objects that subscribe to them is a much more sustainable way to do things than having a million references in each class to other objects, and it makes your code more modular (each class/game object is its own self contained thing). Singleton and Factory patterns, as well as SOLID principles are also good to look into. Factory less so for Unity since you can use GetComponent to retrieve references for things. If you're using Unity, learn to use Unity events/C# events and you will make your code a lot cleaner and save time on large projects.\n",
      "Yes if you think you might want to add multiplayer / co-op you really should do it from the start, suddenly you have to validate everything your players are saying they are doing along with replicating all the right properties without flooding the network and your animations and simulation has to be on point since players will be doing crazy things that AI just wouldn't / we would give AI a pass on\n",
      "I am still alive lol\n",
      "It's going to take some more time, but more devlogs will *actually* be coming!\n",
      "Also, thanks for the crazy amount of support - it means a lot!\n",
      "I've watched this video a bunch of times, it really is SO good. Only just realised I wasn't subbed!\n",
      "I would actually play this game for hours, keep going!\n",
      "actually, i have a plenty good options for the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "those options are:\n",
      "- player has 200 health points\n",
      "- the turret has a field of view / a.i. (if it sees the player, it'll shoot.)\n",
      "- health and power pickups\n",
      "- airborne / aerial targets (such as drones, heavy gunner drones, scout drones, etc.)\n",

I just discovered Core, but didn’t realise it’s a creation tool, I haven’t loaded it up yet and they described it more as an arcade full of games. I’ve had an idea for a cat game for ages since I got three kittens last year and they’re hilarious, I don’t suppose there’s a basic cat model to edit. I draw and paint some, but the oomph goes too easily, I just got back into gaming after a while and you saying ‘I was a bored artist’ resonated. I’ve been wanting to do more with characters I was writing a story for too, heck I even learned code a few years ago, but my passion for websites waned and I found I didn’t love battling all my errors enough to keep going.

      "I’m 35, and I love how, when I was in high school, it was thought of as impractical to become a game developer by most of our parents. I remember being convinced that \"computer stuff is more of a hobby than something you can make a career out of.\" And many of us believed them and decided to go to school for something else. Years later, though, some of us have finally decided to take the leap and make a career change. For years, I’ve wanted to learn how to code, but I always thought I wasn’t smart enough to actually learn how, so I never even tried until the end of last year. Now, my only regret is that I didn’t start learning 20 years ago. But I’ve learned so much is this past year!\n",

      "(Okay...so maybe that was less of a tip and more of a suggestion.)\n",
      "4:54 Totally agree with writing readable code, I just don't think && and ! are the problem at all, in my opinion, if someone sees that as \"hard to read\" they should probably take a step back. I think bad/inconsistent indentation, confusing variable names, repeated code and organization in general are way greater problems that beginner coders do very often.\n",
      "These were lesson's I had to learn the hard way over my four years of development. Thanks for getting this crucial tips out there for people starting out!\n",
      "My unofficial Tip 26:\n",
      "Comment your code. It makes it _SO_ much easier to fix bugs or change things when you can see what pieces of code serve which purposes.\n",
      "Great vid! On the \"controversial\" tip, I agree keep your code readable! But I'd argue this is more about naming properties and functions, and not cramming too much on one line. Replacing !variable with variable == false leans towards being overly verbose to me (I would read !variable as \"not variable\" personally), but whatever makes it easier for you to understand your own code when coming back to it\n",
      "A BIG tip I have to give programmers is to avoid micro optimizations. As a coder it's generally very easy for me to sometimes fall into a pitfall of seeing a piece of my code and trying to optimize it into oblivion.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have fun, then power to you, coding is a hobby after all, but if you're just doing it to save those precious 2ms, it's not worth it by any means, you can do so much better stuff with your time than spending a couple hours optimizing a system for a negligible boost in efficiency.\n",
      "My reflexive advice for someone that's picking between art styles is, \"err on the side of what you can crank out because you can more reliably finish that.\"\n",
      "On that readable code tip (#24), I'd refine that to say \"make sure you can read your own code.\" In a game I'm currently working on, I've added some variables that I could very easily get away without using. The only reason I have them is because they make my code cleaner and easier to work with.\n",
      "Also, make sure you can understand your own code and follow exactly what it does line by line. It is a good idea to create some model or system to define how your code will work, and stick to that model unless an adjustment is absolutely necessary. To that end, I will create empty methods if that's how my model works.\n",
      "5:07 never ever do this\n",
      "'if boolean == false' is horrible form, if an exclamation mark is really too difficult then just use the not keyword but please don't abuse comparison operators like that\n",
      "These are great! I'm working on my ANSI / ASCII Roguelike, and I keep getting caught up in tiny details like changing the color of the player and enemies when they're frozen or poisoned, and tweaking the UI :')\n",

      "The fact that the second game developer was paid less than minimum wage is upsetting. None of the artists were credited as well. Such a shame.\n",
      "The first game felt like a flash game, the second felt like a full release, and the third felt like one of those Unity games with fun physics.\n",
      "Overall, The thumbnail was not only clickbait, but those 3 poor devs were definitely heavily underpaid for their work. I don't think I would be happy only giving them so little money for their work, and not even giving them credit either.\n",
      "As a developer on Fiverr, i think all 3 (but especially the last 2) should've gotten paid way more. This takes at least a couple hours to build, even for an experienced developer, and Fiverr takes 20% of all your revenue. That's not even half of minimum wage.\n",
      "Thumbs up for the developers in your video, thumbs down for you not giving them the exposure they deserve.\n",
      "I feel really sorry for whomever made the second game. They sold themselves short. I mean, you don't owe it to the developer, but it would be really cool if your worked with them to make it a full release. If they're interested. Also, could you give these devs a shout out?\n",
      "I really, REALLY hope this gets backlash. Those devs deserved to be at least credited.\n",
      "Second one was definitely the best, honestly with a few updates to design , ui and the background this could be a top tier mobile game, the background could change to a crystal cavern at a higher lvl and the enemies could change later lvls.\n",
      "Give each of the devs 10% of the earnings by this video as bonus. You still get to keep 70% for the work they did without even getting credit for their work.\n",
      "The third game would have been a lot more interesting with one change. The platforms are hexagons, much smaller, and with several more of them on screen at once. So that you're always in danger of falling into a hole, and not exactly sure where the path is going.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, after reading several other comments, I agree about crediting the developers. However, everyone needs to realise that the prices were agreed upon before development, and the prices were integral to the experiment. If the developers were not OK with the amounts they were paid, then they wouldn't have accepted the job.\n",
      "Opening Blender for the first time is terrifying, where's the \"Make Finished 3D Model\" button?\n",
      "When your game turned pink after the render pipeline switch, that was supposed to happen. It seemed like you had forgotten to change all of the materials to the new RP materials. It should be somewhere in Edit, inside the Rendering, URP, convert all materials. Sorry if I'm wrong though. Good video!\n",

      "You have probably learned this by now, but in your animator on unity, you can make an event somewhere in the animation so when you reach a certain point in the animation you can trigger a function. I'm not very good at english, hope you understood me :)\n",

      "yo, this video has gotten a lot more views than it deserves for being as dumb and badly put together as it was, so I feel like I should clear a few things up.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, to game devs who are just starting out: don't attempt to do exactly what I did, because it probably won't work out well. And I'm not saying this because I think I'm smarter or better at game dev than you. In all honesty, I'm pretty average and tons of people could've done a lot better in my shoes. But that's just the thing, not everyone is in my shoes and has the same experience that I had. Prior to this I'd been making 2D games and was quite familiar with coding, so carrying that over to Unity and 3 dimensions was fairly simple. I mentioned this in the video, but I've seen too many comments in the vein of \"wow this was impressive, I would never be able to do this\" which frankly makes me feel a little bad, since most people probably would be able to do this if they had the same experience I had and I don't want to discourage anyone who doesn't realize this. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I just wanted to reiterate that this was just a video made for shits and giggles by a guy who already knew how to make 2D games and wanted to apply that knowledge to 3 dimensions. Also, everyone learns at their own pace in their own way, and the rate at which that gets done doesn't really matter as long as you're able to learn what you needed to learn in the end (within reason of course, if it takes 8 years to figure out how to print \"hello world\", then we might have a problem). So even if you have as much experience as I did, there should be no reason to feel bad if you take more time. Because ultimately, it doesn't really matter how quickly you're able to learn how to make games. As a game developer, you develop games, and the quality of those games is really the only thing you should be worrying about, not how quickly you can make them. Of course, this mostly only applies if you're doing this as a hobby, and if you have a deadline to meet and bills to pay, you should probably worry a little more.\n",

      "And on the other side of the spectrum, to those who think this video was faked: it wasn't lol. As mentioned before, I already knew how to make 2D games and how to program things, arguably the hardest part of developing games. Because of that, the focus of this video wasn't on that but rather applying what I knew to 3D games by learning 3D modelling, animation, and how to work with Unity, which was fairly easy and straightforward thanks to the massive amounts of documentation and resources available on the internet and such. But mostly this was just for shits and giggles since I find messing around with 3D games entertaining, and I feel like people may be reading into it too much lol. Also there are a few continuity errors that a few people have caught in the dates shown on my computers taskbar, but that was caused by how I usually record clips while video editing, and not when I'm actually making the games. So I just have a weird workflow.\n",

      "The first talk was great. Solo developers can get caught up following professional project management methods but forget the factor of individual motivation. E.g., it might be faster to first deal with the most complex problem, but making small wins working on art or marketing along the way helps you to stay motivated.\n",
      "Was amazing to be involved in this! Hopefully you all can get some good nuggets out of it, along with being more prepared for the hidden pitfalls!\n",
      "The talks were good. But their personal reflections were amazing. We really put these guys on a pedestal but we tend to ignore the emotional impact of solo development. The gratification when the project is finished is amazing but the journey there definitely seems like a rollercoaster.\n",
      "46:24 This is actually insanely important and probably underrated advice. There was a time in my life where I ended up stifling all of my random ideas in the name of \"higher priorities\", and it unwittingly spiraled me into 2-3 years of burnout and depression. This is all in retrospect, because at the time I thought I was doing the right thing, but it's extremely clear to me now that you *need* to give yourself the freedom to create and explore; eventually you'll find the balance of how much time you should set aside for those tangents, and sometimes those tangents turn out to be a core part of your final work!

      "The reason triple AAA games are becoming so expensive and some are totally failing is just because they focus on tech and not on design. They're treating what were supposed to be  enjoyable games as engine demos and not giving enough time to release them properly. You can't just create another GTA V every single year, that shit takes A LOT of time.\n",
      "Another issue is that whenever you sink that much money into a single project, the designers have to give up a significant amount of creative control. Business just won't allow that much money to be spent on an experiment. Everything ends up being the old tried and true so you end up with very samey, uncreative, bland games that look really nice.\n",
      "When some people say \"games from older generations were better\" I must agree.. As a kid I imagined how insane the games would look like with so much more options to buy and play with even better graphics and physics. But sadly nowadays most titles are just cash grabs and the fun part is ignored, its hard to find triple A titles with good and fun gameplay without only pay2win features. Thats why I'm revisiting emulation, indie games and a few AAA titles which are worth the money and also the playtime.\n",
      "I've been telling my friends this for the past couple years. We are going to see fewer AAA games because games not only have to compete with other new releases but all of the pre-existing games as well. There is just so much competition in this industry.\n",
      "Here is my issue with this.\n",
      "\n",
      "AAA game companies are trying too hard to make the 'biggest game'. Big being, best graphics, biggest worlds, widest variety be in customization, weapons, vehicles etc. Which will need lots of people and technology naturally. Which i could excuse that for big game companies withholding new projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Except when you have games like Undertale, Minecraft (before Microsofts purchase) Goosegame, Goat Simulator, powerwash simulator, etc. Getting loads and loads of sales when they're developed by small teams. These games are very basic graphically, have a very short play time (minecraft an exception), no big budget, no fancy effects, no extraordinary acting. But just simple fun\n",

      "Dani is literally the reason I've started game dev. He might not realize this but he's inspired alot of people including me. And  karlson is literally my dream game...mainly because I grew up playing mirror's edge and other parkour games.\n",
      "underrated? I agree he’s extremely good at game development, but he also has millions of subscribers, millions more viewers, and two of his later games both got incredibly well received and took the front page of steam by storm. Not to mention Karlson is incredibly anticipated by millions, and one of the most wishlisted games on steam. Many other solo game-devs out there who pour just as much, if not more time and effort into making games just as good could not dream of that. Someone who likely everyone who clicked on this video already knows is not what i’d call underrated, there are plenty of smaller game devs who are overshadowed by the more well known ones like Dani. I’m not saying it’s his fault or anything, I watch him and support him, i’m just saying the claim that he’s underrated, let alone the most underrated, is incredibly wrong as far as i’m concerned.\n",
      "He ain’t overrated not underrated, he’s a extremely brilliant developer who is wellrated\n",
      "At first, I thought this was going to be a bad retelling of Danis history video but instead it talked about things after that and in-depth telling of crab game and muck that was pretty entertaining. Keep doing what you're doing in a few years you will with no doubt have 1 million if you keep it up.\n",
      "Dani def isn’t the most underrated game dev he has millions of subs 2 front page steam games and so many people know who he is\n",
      "Good video, wouldn't agree with the title though since well he's one of the most popular indie devs out there with an audience of over 3 million on youtube and the 2 free games he put on steam being orders of magnitude bigger than even successful games. But hey titles are titles it didn't really get driven on particularly much in the video.\n",

      "Hey Reece! This is a really cool and unique video idea and great execution :) Love the insights and entertainment I got here since I could also totally relate to all the time consuming tasks of game dev. Usually I calculate for everything 2-3x the time I write down because it usually takes longer and unexpected things start to happen, always!! :)\n",
      "The part of estimating the time needed reminds me of the agile development method of estimating so called \"story points\" to tasks to put them in relation to each other compared to the \"size and complexity\".\n",

      "I was considering about joining a coding bootcamp program for possible game dev applications and job fittings afterwards. Most bootcamps I have come across are primarily web development for tech companies and job placement with companies like google, apple, etc. Are there any game dev bootcamps similar to those? Do they have a high percentage hire rate within so many months after completing their program?\n",
      "These videos are really helpful, I watch them with my friends on Voicely whenever we practice coding. We all agree that we learned more from YouTube videos than from school lol\n",
      "Bro I just learned that the college Im planning on attending next year also has Japanese courses, which I've wanted to do since middle school. Combining that with game development could lead me to working for a Japanese developer like FromSoftware!\n",
      "I like the nods to 'fanboyism' in this presentation 😄.\n",
      "I was unlucky that in my college years, you generally only had 1 option in IT. Which were basically programming for databases and networking. While I specifically went to learn coding and (graphics) designing to create games. I learned the graphics part on my own, also because I had a real knack and passion for it. Coding was more difficult, as information to code for gaming or even a game-engine, were hard to come by (or expensive).\n",
      "Now, almost 2 decades further, our country finally is getting a gaming-industry and there are classes you can follow. I hope I can start in September and hopefully they're not too basic, as I already have some basics.\n",
      "I already tried creating a game twice, sort of. First time was more than a decade ago, supposed to be a fighting game or beat'em up. I got my character modelled (not textured) and even rigged for facial animation. But I soon realized that coding and balancing a fighting game is really hard to do. So much to consider and take into account. And there wasn't even a decent free engine that could provide what I needed.\n",
      "Two years ago, I started again, but with another genre I liked and more manageable (for a single game dev),  an arcade racer. Luckily I was able to pick up Blender easily where I left of (they also made it more user-friendly). And found a decent free game-engine: Godot. Atleast good enough to give me the taste of game-creation and create a tiny concept. I have some videos on my game-dev channel: 'Close Call Racing'on channel 'eyeEmotion'.\n",
      "I have been on a break from it because of renovations at home, which I have to execute myself. And I'm changing to Unreal Engine, since its change in licensing and it's more friendly to devs who are more into designing than programming. I just need that game-dev 1 year course to get the ball rolling again and keep me motivated when I get stuck and the information I need.\n",

      "I was thinking about becoming a game developer who primarily creates code as a hobby. I don't like the art side of it. I figure I would rather download sprites from websites and use those for a 2D indie game. I am learning JavaScript and I was thinking about using three.js and JavaScript for creating a nice small 2D game. Maybe for mobile and importing it to React-Native. I am guessing this will take me another 4 months of learning JavaScript before I am able to program my first small game. I am learning JavaScript for web development, but I think I will at the end pivot into mobile development.\n",

Limited pixel count makes melee combat hard to pull off, so don't be too hard on yourself if you have a hard time making it. If you're not too attached to the melee combat, why not focus on ranged instead? Kinda like cuphead focuses on ranged and has melee on the side.\n",

I don't have a portfolio since I am just starting to reach out to developers for my first opportunity to write for someone but would love to connect to maybe write a test piece for you, and if you like it then we could look into working together.

      "For 2d art i personally use krita. Its free and pretty neat, its good with animation too!\n",
      "Adding this to my Learn how to GameDev playlist\n",
      "Really well put together video, loved the editing as always and I feel that the topic you picked up on today, is one that not many people do touch upon, but is incredibly essential, I know, I've been developing games for over 3 years now, and over one year with Unity. \n",
      "Really important topic and you grabbed it and gave a *perfect* video as always!\n",
      "Good Job!\n",

      "Quick idea: the player is able to construct a mastership between islands with customizable elements that she/he can bring back from exploration.\n",
      "i got a cool idea, maybe have space pirate raids on your ship, in order to keep track of them, you would need to use your ships cameras to see where they are heading, possibly trying to cut off specific parts of the ship with doors in order to allow you to get there in time to take them out (if there is combat), they could probably take a couple slots per chest if they get to it then retreat to their ship, maybe its always flying next to your ship while you are being raided. this could make flying through the world pretty dangerous as at any point pirates could come and raid you. maybe there could be a whole security system that enemies have to get passed, or maybe they could cut your power in half making you unable to escape until all are gone, it could really make the game incredibly fun.\n",
      "This is awesome, I've been working on mine for nearly two years now. Its crazy difficult to keep motivated but i always found myself coming back to get work done. My game releases next month and I can't wait. You've been doing it longer though, I respect you for the sheer amount of motivation you've had to keep up, and for starting a project this big!\n",
      "This game has come a very long way and is looking amazing! Good job so far! Me too is working on a 3d survival game and it is quite fun\n",
      "Those models look great i love the style, also a fan of the editing :)\n",
      "This looks awesome man! I love your idea of being able to make your base mobile and fly. Your terrain designs and creatures are also very cool. Keep up the good work and thanks for the video!\n",
      "The progress is looking super awesome and impressive! Also spending 3 years behind a single project shows dedication. Really like the features that you showed here especially where the one where the base starts flying. For the enemies A, B and C I actually like all of them. You could use all three and give different functionality to them like one of them are predator and hunts the other two and the player.\n",
      "\n",
      "@0:45 you could use blender's \"Merge By Distance\" to merge the vertex. I just enable this by default and give the lowest distance value and blender just merges vertex automatically if they are too close like in your one. Saves lot of time.\n",

      "Keep it up! :)\n",
      "the game looks great i love the models also the video editing skills are great :D i wish i could make even one 3d model lol x''; i subscribed!!\n",
      "It's really bold of you to ditch the safety of your master's degree to pursue your indie dev career. Truly inspiring and thanks for sharing your stats. I hope more indie devs do their sales overview; it helps aspiring game devs like me to gauge what's realistic and what's not when it comes to running a one-man studio\n",

      "I usually don't leave good comments, but you're a pretty funny guy, good personality, and it's a shame that somebody so smart made very little on a really cool game like that. I hope it becomes much more successful. Shout out to all the underdog nerds out there who don't get what they truly deserve.\n",
      "The video was engaging and entertaining. I think continuing this level of quality regardless of topic is probably gonna get your channel to some serious viewership in the future. You seriously deserve more subs than what you have.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Just keep doing what you’re doing. Thanks for the video.\n",
      "Dude that's awesome! It's a lot of money, don't knock yourself down over it. It's nice seeing a small indie dev become successful.\n",
      "The amount of hardwork you put in your video I can't say , you are amazing\n",

      "You should add a playground for the seekers while they wait to be released. A mini jungle gym or something like that so they won't be bored while waiting the 30 seconds.\n",
      "a couple suggestions that might be fun to see in game: ropes that you can swing on would be a welcome addition to diversify gameplay. i think a small fireball would be a cool rock skin to put in the game as well (you can recolor it 5 different times to milk it as much as possible). i'm very exited to see this games future, so good luck.\n",
      "you should add a \"taunt\" ability for the hiders that plays a monkey sound ( the seekers can hear it ) , the hiders can taunt manually but every 2 mins it automatically taunts , because it is still really easy to hide from the seekers\n",
      "An idea for the rock skins: maybe you can make them the gemstones in the cave and make them unlockable by interacting with the gemstones down there? Sounds pretty neat\n",
      "2:18\n",
      "To be honest man, this was actually pretty good! It has a nice friendly yet also slightly cursed (in a good way) feeling to it :)\n",
      "Personally I think adding a way for the seekers to set bananas' as traps that would show the location of a hider that triggers it might be cool :)\n",
      "I have a suggestion for a mechanic that can be easily implemented into this game in a potential update. I suggest making the Cannons functional, allowing The Hides and The Seekers to launch themselves across the map using the cannons.\n",
      "suggestion: maybe instead of giving away the locations of the hiders after a period, why not force to hiders to make monkey noises instead?\n",
      "you should make an button in controls setings \"go crazy\" That randomizes your controls. Dont forget the \"reset controls\" Too.\n",

      "\n",
      "- the data that you feed to a machine learning algorithm can be input-output pairs or just inputs\n",
      "- supervised learning algorithms require input-output pairs (i.e. they require the output)\n",
      "- unsupervised learning requires only the input data (not the outputs)\n",

      "Scenario 2: Recommending new songs based on someone’s past music choices\n",
      "Explanation: It is supervised learning. The model is training a classifier on pre-existing labels (genres of songs).\n",
      "This is what Netflix, Pandora, and Spotify do all the time, they collect the songs/movies that you like already, evaluate the features based on your likes/dislikes and then recommend new movies/songs based on similar features.\n",

      "Scenario 3: Analyze bank data for suspicious-looking transactions and flag the fraud transactions\n",

      "for info: \n",
      "1) At 32:52, to avoid UserWarning: X does not have valid feature names, we need to train the model with the values of input_dataset. i.e, use X.values instead of X in model.fit(X.values, y). \n",
      "2) 42:04, joblib is now a seperate py package. we now need to import it as import joblib rather than from skilearn.externals. \n",

      "I love these videos. I just had a tech exec at a Fortune 200 company ask me for any podcasts that could help him stay abreast of current/emerging technology. I didn't have a great answer for him, but I did mention this series. He was looking for more audio-centric content though. Food for thought, @IBM Technology!\n",
      "So I do like this series, but this confused me because he switched from one output - \"should I buy pizza\" - to another output - \"is this a pizza or a taco\". Is this a fundamental difference in what DL vs ML is able to do? Or that the first output doesn't require as many layers to become a neural network so therefore would always sit at a DL level? Sorry, I think I need to do more study and come back to this video\n",

      "I always find it interesting that the statement \"logistic regression is a classification method\" is repeated so often, despite 'regression' being right there in the name.  Like decision trees (CART), random forest and other similar methods, there are both regression and classification versions of the method.  In a binary outcome problem, we model the process as flipping a coin that has a probability p of coming up heads (1) and 1-p of coming up tails (0).  We can either predict p, a continuous value between 0 and 1, or we can predict the outcome, itself, which is in {0,1}.  The former is regression; the latter is classification.  Logistic regression predicts that probability p and logistic classification takes that probability and uses a cutoff (sometimes, but not always, 0.5) to predict the outcome.  Many times, the probability is more important (for example, lots of the same type of customer -> you do not want to assume all of them are 1's, when p is estimated to be 0.6) and sometimes the outcome is more important (for example, making a decision to approve an application for credit.)\n",
      "I'm taking a machine learning course and this is what I needed to completely understand each method. Great video, concise and easy to follow. Thanks!\n",
      "It may surprise some people, but logistic REGRESSION is in fact a regression model. The output is continuous: it's a probability. Of course you can dichotomize the output and create a classifier. Just like you can dichotomize any score function or regression model output. So the distinction between regression and classification is not so clear cut.\n",
      "You can also get multi-class classification where the output is more then 2, also you can use neural networks for classification also.\n",

      "You did a great job introducing the \"how to learn\" aspect of what I think stumps a lot of intimidated curious learners. Basically, when you explained \"When I saw this I didn't know what it meant, so I googled it.\" That is crazily enough, a big lesson to learn.  Just hearing that at least is encouraging me to take my first independent steps to learning this stuff.  So of course, thanks for the video!\n",

      "I guess you can't teach self-driving cars using RL in the real world (punishing them if they collide would be a little too late).

      "The most surprising thing for me is that I have always been interested in AI but did not know what computer science classes to take to follow this through. I ended up taking a fundamentals to data science class this semsester and it taught me much of the Basic AI algorithms that you mentioned.  I guess luck is on my side lol\n",
      "Also it may be wise to learn MATLAB to a fairly advanced level before doing ML. The jump from basic Python to ML is quite a big one,  I was not able to make that jump and got fired from my job because of it. You must know how to populate matrices by row and column, take the average, etc. A basic Python course won't cover these things, but MATLAB courses are more specific for the type of things you will be doing as an machine learning engineer or data scientist.\n",
      "Hey Tim, good video! One thing I would say is that I wouldn't recommend beginners to start with Reinforcement Learning - as a matter of fact I think that's one of the more advanced applications.

      "You should learn machine learning even if you don't intend to be a machine learning engineer.   ML is a tool, an important one that can help make sense from data.   In the future,  knowing how to use ML as a tool will be equivalent to knowing how to use Excel today.   It doesn't mean that everyone needs to know how to build a spreadsheet application but one would be highly handicapped if he or she doesn't know how to use one.\n",
      "ML reminds me Big Data's hype few years ago, some senior software engineers were scared of being overtaken by junior if they did not learn it, so they wanted to \"train\" themselves puting an Hadoop stack in every single projects they were working on, until they eventually understood it was not the holy grail of data processing. It just allows to solve some problems (and not all) in a more efficient way than other methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think people in tech industry should all learn what  ML is, what it can do, hardware requierments and what gains it can provide, so  they can know if they really need it. Then, maybe, they should learn it in depth, but first search if there is an existing product that meet their requierements.\n",

      "I learnt how to make, train and use neural networks 20 years ago as part of my academical training. Did I make NN since then ? No. Did I have used libs or services relying on NN ? Yes, quite often. That's quite a different thing.\n",
      "Well, as someone who likes research in AI, I give major credit to Software Engineer. The math is pretty intense to always remember so Software Engineers are very good at making black boxes that are reusable. So I think everyone in technology is just as important.\n",
      "I absolutely agree with you. From my experience toward my research, machine learning is only useful if there is data available to extract features. However, if you are extracting features from unknown observation then model-based approach is very useful. These days a hybrid between model-based approach and machine learning techniques are useful\n",

      "This lecture is awesome and really inspiring. I've been a fan now for years now Lex, and I'm really happy to see your success. I just wanted to point out that I believe your analysis of \"One Shot Learning\" re: human bipedal locomotion might be a little off base. The learning and development process that leads to bipedalism is characterized by a list of precursors like crawling, sitting up, and standing up. This process takes usually between 1 and 2 years. This time (and the hundreds if not thousands of reps that come with it) is needed to build from the ground up both the requisite muscular strength and the requisite neural pathways for these coordinations to be possible. The process can be accelerated through coordination-specific training on the part of the parents (which occurs quite often). Errors that occur in this process lead to hardcore biomechanical problems down the road (e.g. requiring knee replacement at 55) Bipedalism is pretty complex, and is way harder than quadrupedalism, which would fall more in the scope of your one shot learning claim.\n",

      "Great introduction. Just one point at 2:02:30 Tuple for single column is passed in wrong way and thats why it returned data series. It should be df.loc[:,(\"START*\",) instead of  df.loc[:,(\"START*\") to get the dataframe. As in Pyhton () brackets are used for expressions or for functions. (2+3) will be evaluated into 5 and (\"START*\") will be evaluated into string \"START*\" and thus when there is single element in a TUPLE it must be represented with comma at the end.\n",

      "Hello. I am not (yet) an ML enthusiast, but clicked on the video because of the slight curiosity I have about it. But the \"no-zero days\" mention makes sense, & is a good reminder that such consistency is important for achieving one's goals.\n",
      "Thankyou for this video, This is really so amazing. I just didn't even think that way to look at what companies want from us but either way I am going to learn it for just fun😂😂  but maybe later on I would like to switch my carrier in it. Thankyou ❤\n",
      "I have just started to look into ML and learn more about it and this video is an absolute motivator! Thanks! Subscribed!\n",
      "I think Math is important because if you are trying to solve a problem with mL you need to at least or have an idea of what each mathematical concept/formula are going to solve and perfect for your problem.\n",

      "This was such a great refresher course. Everything I needed to recollect and on point. Great job and thank you!\n",
      "This is honest to god a great lecture and perfect for introducing deep learning! I hope there’s another video in the future that shows some light programming.\n",
      "It was a good introductory course! Although there's lack of examples in the explanation of neural network part. But overall you can get the idea of how deep learning works.\n",

      "Awesome video, Jason. You've helped make this information accessible to thousands of new people.\n",
      "Short and crisp overview of deep learning with cool intuitions. This is the only video that I will recommend to anyone who wants to start with deep learning and even machine learning in general.\n",
      "Great video! I like the structure and the depth of knowledge shown in it.\n",
      "This would be substantially more terrifying if the bots weren't drawn to be so cute...\n",

      "We can recreate it, we benefit from it yet we have no clue why or how it's actually working beyond luck\n",
      "When Grey was talking about the warehouses and slaughterhouses, all I could do was think of Star Wars: the bots are basically equivalent to clones on Kamino. I would say the bots are less sentient, but the way Grey has depicted them makes that less certain and the comparison all the stronger.\n",
      "The topology of the learning network is based on that of the \"Perceptron\" built in the '50s with relays. In the end, the network conduct a converging weighting of probabilities to identify the correct event. Yes, even a picture is considered an event, a static one though. A dinamic event is defined by using vector spaces.\n",
      "Thank you for the nice video!\n",
      "This is absolutely insane, I love this video and the way it explains everything (though I guess that isn't specific to this video)\n",

      "checking in again after a google engineer claimed their LaMDA AI was sentient\n",
      "\n",
      "this isn't the type of machine learning that AI uses, but still fascinating\n",
      "As a comp sci student, I find it interesting how you explained this, but rather than “teaching” I would more describe it as “evolution”. You know, like only the strongest, or most fit for whatever task, survive till the next generation. Just like in real life, birds might not know why they fly south, only that they do so every year, same with the bots and their tasks. I think explaining this way (at least for me) is easier, because bots don’t “learn” they evolve through the generations.\n",
      "This was so helpful, I'm currently trying to teach my Pit Amiibo how to fight properly and this is going to help me big time in training it.\n",
      "You’re such a great teacher!! All the bots look sooo cute as well and comprehensible graphics like always :D\n",
      "At times I feel so lucky being born in this age of internet, Otherwise it was no way possible for me to learn from this legend of machine learning for free, looking at this career  across academia and industry , he is a pioneer . It like learning integral calculus from Newton himself.\n",
      "I just love how humble and friendly this prof is. Big fan\n",
      "I am a 12th-grade student and really interested in machine learning. I did some basic math which is required in machine learning and am starting with this course today. I really liked the fact that the language which is used in this course is python. so excited to learn about this new branch. Will try my best to complete it. THANK YOU STANFORD FOR UPLOADING THESE LECTURES.\n",
      "Andrew Ng is a legend. I took his course on Coursera and I wish the course never ended. I have taking a lot of Machine learning courses but none of them compare to Andrew's. He made complex concepts look trivial and established a theoretical background ('Intuition' as he would say).\n",
      "the way this man teaches is something which doesn't get you tired. you will watch him teach with a beaming smile on your face.\n",

      "This is so exceptional  and simplified, am so grateful for this.\n",
      "it's not always that you want an unlimited dataset in machine learning. Sometimes you want to limit your dataset. For example if you're trying to figure out if you're in a stock market recession or expansion you don't want to go over 2 years (+- months) of data because you'll end up in another cycle. Symmetry and Domain limits are important in machine learning. My point is sometimes too much data is a waste of time and resources\n",
      "thanks a lot MIT. If it is possible,could you make the videos of 18.04 Complex Variable with applications?I really want to watch that course.Thank you very much.😁\n",
      "Correction:\n",
      "4:06 I say that the difference in fits between the training dataset and the testing dataset is called Variance. However, I should have said that the difference is a _consequence_ of variance. Technically, variance refers to the amount by which the predictions would change if we fit the model to a different training data set.\n",

      "I'm only 12 minutes into this video right now, but I just wanted to say how much I appreciate the time and spacing you give to explaining a concept. You add pauses, you repeat things with slightly different wording, and you give examples and zoom in and out, linking to relevant thought processes that might help trigger an \"a-ha\" moment in the viewer. Many of these \"hooks\" actually make me understand concepts I've had trouble grasping in Maths, all because of your videos and the way you choose to explain things. So thanks! You're helping me a lot to become a smarter person. :)\n",

      "Hi everyone, exactly a week ago, we conducted a contest in this video. The answer to the question is given below:\n",
      "The correct order of working for Neural Network with explanation: \n",
      "B. The weighted sum of inputs is calculated\n",
      "A. The Bias is added\n",
      "D. The result is fed to an activation function\n",
      "C. Specific Neuron is activated\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation: In a neural network, each neuron in one layer is connected to other neurons in the corresponding layers. These connections carry random weights. The weighted sum of the inputs is calculated, and an additional input in the form of bias is added (w * x + b). The result of this is fed to an activation function. Based on a particular threshold value, only those neurons get activated that crosses the threshold value.\n",

      "The hard part about Machine Learning is not the how but the what. I can plot learning curves very easily, but reading them is another story. That's why I like to focus my ML videos on the concepts rather than the code. Chances are that the code is doable in two lines. But if you can't understand the output (or why your data might give you certain kinds of output) you're wasting time and resources\n",
      "Just about to finish my first year studying statistics. A short course was about machine learning so I have some knowledge and understanding of machine learning so this was a very interesting video. We got to use and tweak different types of predictor models. We split the available data into training and test data and then used the training data, which included the outcome variable, to build the models and the test data, which didn't include the outcome variable, to test the models and later compare their results to the true outcome variable\n",

In my code I changed the test_size value to 0.5 and the random_state to 7, I got a nice prediction for arrays [3] & [5] but not for array[9] for example!

      "I would also like to point out that actually *understanding* machine learning well enough to tweak models effectively or read white papers on topics (as was mentioned as a benefit, being part of something), will be EXTREMELY difficult to do without a fairly high level of knowledge in linear algebra and probability + statistics. In fact, at my university, in order to enrol in the first machine learning course, you need to have taken 4 semesters of calculus (with proofs, as it highlights mathematical maturity one develops), one or two courses in linear algebra, and 2 courses in statistics. \n",
      "That’s not to say it’s impossible to use ML without that, of course it isn’t. However, it is difficult to engage academically with the material without sufficient math knowledge (much more so than with required programming knowledge for ML). \n",
      "So yes, you will be “a part of something”, in that as the field develops you might have fun new models to play around with, but it’s a bit disingenuous to suggest people will be able to comprehend ML publications at a meaningful level, or be generating their own custom models\n",
      "In my eyes, the second con is the worst thing that can happen to you in ml. In many cases I would eagerly wait for about 5-6 hours for the model to train, to see it not work at all in the way I intended. I'd keep training the model day after day after making small changes in the  code to see its performance not getting better at all.\n",

      "I'm taking a few online ML tutorials and have a text book (not related to the course) and I have to say that it is very similar to what I did in econometric with regards to predicting. The regression analysis in ML is the same as I did in econometric but I just I didn't use python to do it, I was using Stata, but you could use R to do the same thing and now days I'm sure they are teaching python in economics. At any rate, even after taking econometrics and taking a ML course I still find it hard to use this knowledge for anything specific or maybe more aptly how to apply this knowledge to anything useful. Albeit I do recognize that ML is a large topic and the first part of learning ML that I am doing (including the textbook) all start off doing Regression Analysis and maybe that is what everyone doesn't use when they talk about ML and the other parts I have yet to get to like AI and Neural Networks is all the rage that everyone is talking about? IDK.\n",
      "\n",
      "I often hear people say that ML is used for large datasets like at Netflix, Google, Amazon or etc to help suggest something (or something along those lines). Well, that's all fine and good, but I don't work at a company like Netflix or Google in terms of having that much data or that level of skill. The other problem is that to use ML at such companies is not really covered as they simple will say in the textbook or ML course that it is very complicated and won't go into. Thus, kind of making the example of these FANG companies almost useless in the short term, and medium term. When you learn about ML you often will be taught forecasting and you will be able to display it on a nice chart/graph with a line through it e.g. the trend line. Technically, you could use EXCEL to reproduce some of the things I have learned in ML, so at times feels kind of pointless and demotivating.  Or, other things in ML like predict a single element if you have data on peoples age, salary, and whether or not they bought a car. You can then ask your data if someone at 30 years old and that makes $70k will they buy a car? It will be based off a percentage, of course but it will come out as a 1 or 0 indicating they bought it or not.  The problem is normally at the end of all these tutorials the instructor will say something like the data you see in real life will never look like this and say this is for educational purposes. And real life application is much harder as it has more variables etc. So, it becomes hard to do your own projects in ML because they don't really explain what variables you should be including or looking at for your own projects.     \n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the time the ML tutorials focuses on how to do the predication/trend line and not care how you got the data and what data items you should be using. They just give you datasets from a website or make their own dataset. This is a huge issue if you want to try doing ML on your own data because they don't teach you what data you should be capturing or what practical purposes you could use this for on a smaller scale such as a small-medium business or say your website has x amount of traffic, etc.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm often left wondering how the ML regression Analysis chart that has a slope and line of best fit will be used in anything that they mention such as the things they say at the start of the chapter. For example, in my book they talk about using ML to create a spam filter and then you start off at the basics of learning about linear regression. Or they talk about using housing price data to predict how expensive a house will be based off like 5-7 factors. But to be honest the housing sample is a great example, but I often have trouble trying to think of a problem that I could create using ML to predict a result (ie my own project). Also, the examples often are intuitive, like yeah the bigger a house the more expensive its going to be I don't even need data or run ML on it to know that. It can get de-motiving at times. So, the examples are illustrator of basically what you already know to be true. Like predicting gas prices will be higher in the Summer time because more people drive because of more people take vacation/travel during summer. Also, they never mention how to implement that line graph into an application like the mentioned spam filter. It's 200+ pages like that. Countless hours of videos from tutorials saying, \"Now, of course the real life data will not look anything like this, but you get the idea\"...    I am kind of stuck in-between smashing my head against the wall listening to the instructor on how a graph with a slope is ML and hoping that the next item they teach will get me to what I want. I'm tempted to skip 20 hours or 200+ pages ahead and dive into the Neural Networks but can't stop thinking that maybe Regression Analysis is going to be required or some of the tricks you are suppose to learn along the way  will be helpful in the AI section, or whatever. \n",
      "\n",
      "So far, it's like learning basic Statistics but in Python.\n",
      "I'm a data scientist and 95% of my job is data collection and preparation, it's still a cool job but it's not all model development\n",
      "at first I thought i will learn machine learning in 6 months, with some coding experience. i dedicated 5 hours on normal day and 10 hours a day on weekends to study the field and make it in 6 months.\n",
      "and guess what, in reality it took me 1+ year of hard working and studying this field to be able to build deploy deep learning models and to only begin comprehending state of the art models and begin to mix different algorithms to solve a specific problem.\n",
      "time may vary from person to other but real hard work and dedication is required.\n",
      "if i was to go back and change the way i learned things rather than just jumping to the field :\n",
      "first to learn data structures and algorithms, programming logic.\n",
      "then try to learn and apply some basic algorithms like binary search, reverse linked list, string manipulation..., this will help you so much to improve coding skills.\n",
      "the first step will help you so much in processing data solving problems related to data and getting your models to work using your own way.\n",
      "second learn some basic calculus and statistics, linear algebra, probability, dot product,  gradient descent...\n",
      "third learn machine learning algorithms and try to apply them using your programming skills.\n",
      "The only thing holding me back is that it took about 30 mins to implement a classification algorithm with a data size of around 20 numbers on a powerful laptop. It was straightforward and a lot of fun but when the size of the data increases, it might go on for even a week with GPUs. It pays well but so does frontend development at any decent company. This video didn't give any valuable inputs to make a decision\n",
      "IMO, Machine Learning is a lot of math. It is very difficult to find an interesting job without advance degree if it is the goal of learning ML.\n",

Do some ML algorithms create these features and features maps automatically, or are these always created outside of the algorithm? \n",

      "Great animation.keep it up.\n",
      "*Thanks for sharing what is machine learning using such good animation*\n",
      "I am currently enrolled in a MSc Machine learning masters here in the UK, and we are learning both the theory and putting it into practice using the assignments. There really isn't a problem of doing it both. Stop telling yourself you can't.. If you put in the time and effort with the right learning mindset and method, you can learn to eat and drink at the same time. Just need to be smart about it. Stop putting these limiting thoughts on yourself. It really isn't that hard.\n",
      "I came for a machine learning related talk but I got a life lesson, thanks Daniel nice content! \n",
      "\n",
      "PS: I was thinking about going into ML field but I now realized it's due to engineer disease. I'm sticking with web apps at least for some time until I can decide what I love and what I don't.\n",
      "I've worked for about 2 years with ML/computer vision and a lot of the things in this video resonated. When I started out I was frustrated that I couldn't dive directly into designing new advanced mathematical models right away but I realized there are a lot of \"boring\" things that need to be in place before that's even relevant (data curation, annotation, testing frameworks etc just to name a few). There are a lot of interesting problems to solve along the way that I probably wouldn't even realize existed if I stayed in academia for a PhD. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think there is a point to be made for switching back and forth between learning \"tools for the sake of tools\" and solving problems though. As long as you spend enough effort to make some progress each time it can really help keeping things fresh\n",
      "I come from a physics background, and usually we spend a lot of time concerning with theory, trying to enrich our theoretical knowledge as much as we can. A lot of colleagues in my department don't understand that trying to learn everything is an infinite loop. During my masters I realized how important is to just start doing things with curiosity, which led me to collaborate in two amazing projects. Now that I'm finishing my masters and starting to get into ML engineering I see how this mindset is even more crucial to let you accomplish the things you want. Amazing content you put there, mate! Thanks from Brazil!\n",
      "Back when I was learning to code I didn’t know anything or what to do and how to do it. I asked a friend of mine how I could what books I should read etc. first thing he did was stop me in my sentence and say “you don’t need to research all these functions and data structures and take notes from textbooks, you just need to know what is possible” and that really reasonated  with me because once you know what is possible, you can think of a problem and as the video states “learn by doing”, my friend said to work I’m projects I want to solve or replicate and implement what I have learned that way. Rather than sitting around reading these books.\n",
      "I really like the point about engineering toolboxes. I think that’s where a lot of the burnout comes from. I work in DevOps and teach full stack so going to school for machine learning sounds like a large leap. Learning how to build better ML pipelines are much more worth my time.\n",
      "I’ve just started exploring this field. And this was a really good reminder to get so early on the journey. Thanks a lot!\n",
      "Excelente video con una pregunta filosófica profunda. Gracias por compartir esta reflexión sobre la base de tu experiencia.\n",
      "Pregunta: cuáles son las tres herramientas (framework, data base and code writing) de las que hablaste en el vídeo que tú usas?\n",
      "Hey Daniel, just discovered your channel a couple days ago and I'm learning lots. Thank you!\n",
      "This is great. Focus is key. A playful approach can also speed things up depending on how you learn and of course patience. For those interested in R and python, the latest R studio IDE is great and allows you to run both side by side with reticulate. It can seem a steep curve but those with a grounding in R and statistics you can run ML scripts side by side and learn the similarities and where they differ.\n"
